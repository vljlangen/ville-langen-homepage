We also propose a framework for implementing assessment of hypertension onset age into clinical practice. Recent Findings: Prior studies have used both objective measurements and self-report to determine age of hypertension onset or early-onset hypertension. Yet, no criterion for standard definition currently exists for either. Data from epidemiological and clinical studies demonstrate that early-onset hypertension is a highly heritable trait that confers an increased risk for cardiovascular death and end-organ damage compared with late-onset hypertension. Summary: Literature to date suggests that (parental) age of hypertension onset can be feasibly assessed for estimating (1) risk of future hypertension in non-hypertensive persons; and (2) the propensity for cardiovascular disease in individuals with established hypertension.},

We aimed to assess whether the initiation of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy in patients with AF differs between those with rural and urban residence. Methods The registry-based FinACAF cohort covers all patients with AF from all levels of care in Finland. Patients were divided into rural and urban categories and into urbanization degree tertiles based on their municipality of residence at the time of AF diagnosis. The outcome was the first redeemed OAC prescription. Results We identified 222 419 patients (50.1\% female; mean age 72.8 (SD 13.2) years) with incident AF during 2007–2018. Urban residence was associated with a lower rate of OAC therapy initiation (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) (95\% CI) 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). Correspondingly, an inverse graded dose-response relationship was observed between higher urbanization degree tertile and OAC initiation rate (highest tertile compared to lowest: adjusted SHR (95\% CI) 0.94 (0.93–0.95)). The adoption of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention was faster among patients with urban residence. Conclusion This nationwide cohort study documented that urban residence is associated with a slightly lower rate of OAC therapy initiation in patients with incident AF, but faster adoption of direct oral anticoagulant use.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized a role of adaptive immunity, and particularly T cells, in the genesis of hypertension. We sought to determine the T-cell subtypes that contribute to hypertension and renal inflammation in angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Using T-cell receptor spectratyping to examine T-cell receptor usage, we demonstrated that CD8+ cells, but not CD4+ cells, in the kidney exhibited altered T-cell receptor transcript lengths in Vβ3, 8.1, and 17 families in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Clonality was not observed in other organs. The hypertension caused by angiotensin II in CD4CD25-/- and MHCIICD25-/- mice was similar to that observed in wild-type mice, whereas CD25-/- mice and OT1xRAG-1CD25-/- mice, which have only 1 T-cell receptor, exhibited a blunted hypertensive response to angiotensin II. Adoptive transfer of pan T cells and CD8+ T cells but not CD4+/CD25- cells conferred hypertension to RAG-1CD25-/- mice. In contrast, transfer of CD4+/CD25+ cells to wild-type mice receiving angiotensin II decreased blood pressure. Mice treated with angiotensin II exhibited increased numbers of kidney CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In response to a sodium/volume challenge, wild-type and CD4CD25-/- mice infused with angiotensin II retained water and sodium, whereas CD25-/- mice did not. CD25-/- mice were also protected against angiotensin-induced endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in the kidney. These data suggest that in the development of hypertension, an oligoclonal population of CD8+ cells accumulates in the kidney and likely contributes to hypertension by contributing to sodium and volume retention and vascular rarefaction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND There have been few large epidemiological studies examining the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. In particular, it is uncertain if subclinical hypothyroidism is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. METHODS Serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine concentrations were measured in 2108 archived serum samples from a 1981 community health survey in Busselton, Western Australia (Busselton Health Study). In a cross-sectional study, we examined the prevalence of coronary heart disease in subjects with and without subclinical thyroid dysfunction. In a longitudinal study, we examined the risk of cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease events (fatal and nonfatal combined) to the end of 2001 (excluding subjects who had coronary heart disease at baseline). RESULTS In the cross-sectional analysis, subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 119) had a significantly higher prevalence of coronary heart disease than euthyroid subjects (n = 1906) (age- and sex-adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.8; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1; P = .04). In the longitudinal analysis of subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 101), there were 21 cardiovascular deaths observed compared with 9.5 expected (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-2.4; P = .08) and 33 coronary heart disease events observed compared with 14.7 expected (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.7; 95\% confidence interval, 1.2-2.4; P {\textless} .01). The increased risk of coronary heart disease events remained significant after further adjustment for standard cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects with subclinical hyperthyroidism (n = 39) had no adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION Subclinical hypothyroidism may be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A limited number of studies have suggested a nonlinear association between spot urine (SU) sodium concentration and office blood pressure (BP). We examined how SU sodium concentration and dietary salt obtained from a food frequency questionnaire are associated with more accurately measured home BP in a large, nationwide population sample.Materials and methods: We included 1398 participants in cross-sectional and 851 participants in 11-year longitudinal analyses. We investigated associations between baseline salt/sodium variables and (i) baseline and follow-up home BP; and (ii) prevalent and incident hypertension with linear and logistic regression models.Results: We observed positive associations (β ± standard error) between salt/sodium variables and BP in unadjusted models. SU sodium concentration associated with baseline systolic (0.04 ± 0.01, p {\textless} 0.001) and diastolic (0.02 ± 0.01, p {\textless} 0.001) BP and follow-up systolic (0.03 ± 0.01, p = 0.003) and diastolic (0.02 ± 0.01, p {\textless} 0.001) BP. Dietary salt intake was associated with baseline (0.52 ± 0.19, p = 0.008) and follow-up (0.57 ± 0.20, p = 0.006) systolic BP. Compared to the lowest quintile of SU sodium concentration, the highest quintile had greater odds of prevalent hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.19) and the second highest quintile with incident hypertension (OR 1.86, 95\% CI 1.05-3.34). Unadjusted odds of incident hypertension were higher in the highest as compared to the lowest quintile of dietary salt intake (OR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.01-3.35). After adjustments for sex, age, plasma creatinine concentration and alcohol intake, none of the aforementioned associations remained statistically significant. We found no evidence of a J-shaped association between the salt/sodium variables and BP or hypertension.Conclusion: SU sodium concentration and dietary salt intake are associated with home BP and hypertension only in some of the unadjusted models. Our results underscore that feasible estimation of sodium intake remains challenging in epidemiology. What is known about the topicSome studies have suggested a non-linear association between spot urine sodium and blood pressure24-hour urinary sodium sampling is the gold standard method for assessing sodium intakeWhat this study addsMultiple fractional polynomials did not reveal evidence of a J-shaped association between spot urine sodium or dietary salt intake (measured by a questionnaire) and home blood pressurePrecise and yet feasible estimation of sodium intake remains challenging in epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND When otherwise unexplained, syncope in patients with Alzheimer's disease may be attributed to bradycardia caused by cholinesterase inhibitors. We studied prospectively the clinical events and cardiovascular changes occurring during treatment with donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS Consecutive patients presenting with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease were included in the study. Their clinical characteristics, blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram were recorded before (baseline) and during treatment with donepezil. The drug was administered at a dosage of 5 mg/day for 1 month and 10 mg/day for the following 7 months, as tolerated. We compared the baseline observations with those made at 1, 2 and 8 months of donepezil treatment. We also examined the effects of negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs concomitantly administered with donepezil. RESULTS Thirty patients were included in the study, of whom 43\% were taking negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs. The first month of therapy (donepezil 5 mg/day) was completed by 26 patients. During the 7-month high-dosage phase (10 mg/day), four patients dropped out of the study; thus, 22 patients completed the full 8 months of the study. The mean heart rate was 66 +/- 8 beats/min at baseline in the overall study population. This decreased significantly to 62 +/- 9, 61 +/- 7 and 62 +/- 8 beats/min at the 1, 2 and 8 month timepoints, respectively (all p = 0.002 vs baseline). Among patients not receiving negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs, heart rate decreased significantly over the course of the study (from 67 +/- 8 beats/min at baseline to 62 +/- 8 beats/min at 1 month, 62 +/- 7 beats/min at 2 months and 62 +/- 8 beats/min at 8 months [all p = 0.005 vs baseline]). There was no significant change in heart rate in patients who were receiving negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs. The PR interval increased over the course of the study in all patient groups, but these changes were only statistically significant in the group of patients who were not taking negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs (155 +/- 23ms at baseline vs 158 +/- 21, 160 +/- 22 and 163 +/- 24ms at the 1, 2 and 8 month timepoints; all p = 0.02 vs baseline). One patient developed syncope due to orthostatic hypotension; there were no cases of bradycardia-induced syncope. Gastrointestinal manifestations were reported in ten of the study patients. Abdominal pain and vomiting were the reasons for study termination in five of the eight patients who did not complete the trial. CONCLUSION A donepezil-induced decrease in heart rate and increase in PR interval were observed only in patients with Alzheimer's disease who were not treated with negatively chronotropic or dromotropic drugs. These changes were not associated with bradycardia-induced syncope.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND There is no cure for dementia, and no treatments exist to halt or reverse the course of the disease. Treatments are aimed at improving cognitive and functional outcomes. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to review the basis of pharmacological treatments for dementia and to summarize the benefits and risks of dementia treatments. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE through November 2014, for English-language trials and observational studies on treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Additional references were identified by searching bibliographies of relevant publications. Whenever possible, pooled data from meta-analyses or systematic reviews were obtained. Studies were included for review if they were randomized trials or observational studies on dementia or mild cognitive impairment that evaluated efficacy outcomes or adverse outcomes associated with treatment. Studies were excluded if they evaluated non-FDA approved treatments, or if they evaluated treatment in disorders other than dementia and mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS The literature search found 540 potentially relevant studies, of which 257 were included in the systematic review. In pooled trial data, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) produce small improvements in cognitive, functional, and global benefits in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia, but the clinical significance of these effects are unclear. There is no significant benefit seen for vascular dementia. The efficacy of ChEI treatment appears to wane over time, with minimal benefit seen after 1 year. There is no evidence for benefit for those with advanced disease or those aged over 85 years. Adverse effects are significantly increased with ChEIs, in a dose-dependent manner. A two- to fivefold increased risk for gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular side effects is related to cholinergic stimulation, the most serious being weight loss, debility, and syncope. Those aged over 85 years have double the risk of adverse events compared with younger patients. Memantine monotherapy may provide some cognitive benefit for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, but the benefit is small and may wane over the course of several months. Memantine exhibits no significant benefit in mild dementia or Lewy body dementia or as an add-on treatment with ChEIs. Memantine has a relatively favorable side-effect profile, at least under controlled trial conditions. CONCLUSIONS ChEIs produce small, short-lived improvements in cognitive function in mild to moderate dementia, which may not translate into clinically meaningful effects. Marginal benefits are seen with severe disease, long-term treatment, and advanced age. Cholinergic side effects, including weight loss, debility, and syncope, are clinically significant and could be especially detrimental in the frail elderly population, in which the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits.

	abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including prevalence and incidence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and 2021, when COVID-19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's was the seventh-leading cause of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145\%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at \$339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Members of the paid health care workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage - brought about, in part, by COVID-19 - has occurred at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better train health care teams. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \$345 billion. The Special Report examines whether there will be sufficient numbers of physician specialists to provide Alzheimer's care and treatment now that two drugs are available that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recognized as a major health hazard that mostly affects people older than 60 years. AD is one of the biggest medical, economic, and social concerns to patients and their caregivers. AD was ranked as the 5th leading cause of global deaths in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Many drugs targeting the production, aggregation, and clearance of Aβ plaques failed to give any conclusive clinical outcomes. This mainly stems from the fact that AD is not a disease attributed to a single-gene mutation. Two hallmarks of AD, Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), can simultaneously induce other AD etiologies where every pathway is a loop of consequential events. Therefore, the focus of recent AD research has shifted to exploring other etiologies, such as neuroinflammation and central hyperexcitability. Neuroinflammation results from the hyperactivation of microglia and astrocytes that release pro-inflammatory cytokines due to the neurological insults caused by Aβ plaques and NFTs, eventually leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This review will report the failures and side effects of many anti-Aβ drugs. In addition, emerging treatments targeting neuroinflammation in AD, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), that restore calcium dyshomeostasis and microglia physiological function in clearing Aβ plaques, respectively, will be deliberately discussed. Other novel pharmacotherapy strategies in treating AD, including disease-modifying agents (DMTs), repurposing of medications used to treat non-AD illnesses, and multi target-directed ligands (MTDLs) are also reviewed. These approaches open new doors to the development of AD therapy, especially combination therapy that can cater for several targets simultaneously, hence effectively slowing or stopping AD.},

	abstract = {Background: A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of deposited Aβ, is being investigated for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease. Methods: We conducted a phase 2 trial of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who had tau and amyloid deposition on positron-emission tomography (PET). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog13), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET. Results: A total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo. The baseline iADRS score was 106 in both groups. The change from baseline in the iADRS score at 76 weeks was −6.86 with donanemab and −10.06 with placebo (difference, 3.20; 95\% confidence interval, 0.12 to 6.27; P = 0.04). The results for most secondary outcomes showed no substantial difference. At 76 weeks, the reductions in the amyloid plaque level and the global tau load were 85.06 centiloids and 0.01 greater, respectively, with donanemab than with placebo. Amyloid-related cerebral edema or effusions (mostly asymptomatic) occurred with donanemab. Conclusions: In patients with early Alzheimer's disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. Longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer's disease.},

Antibody-based immunotherapy against Aβ to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated Aβ. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to enter the brain, bind parenchymal Aβ, and reduce soluble and insoluble Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Aβ in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study intends to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil for improving cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to provide evidence-based foundation for donepezil in MCI treatment. METHODS We searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical trials.gov, Web of Science, CQVIP, and CNKI databases, and then we summarized the interventional and observational studies on the use of donepezil for improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. The literature was collected according to the inclusion criteria for data extraction. We evaluated the quality of the selected literature and used Stata 15.0 for meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 non-randomized concurrent controlled trials (CCTs) were included, and a total of 2847 patients were included. In terms of efficacy, meta-analysis showed that donepezil could significantly improve the MMSE (SMD: 0.85, 95\%CI: 0.40-1.31) and MoCA (SMD: 1.88, 95\%CI: 0.32-3.45) scores of MCI patients. Donepezil could not significantly reduce ADAS-cog score, nor could it significantly delay disease progression. The quality of the evidence was low overall. In terms of safety, donepezil could significantly increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea in patients with MCI. CONCLUSION Donepezil can improve the cognitive function of MCI patients to a certain extent. However, there is no trend of significantly delaying the progression of the disease, and it is easy to lead to the occurrence of adverse reactions.},

Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta. OBJECTIVES We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN EMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. SETTING These studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1638 (EMERGE) and 1647 (ENGAGE) patients (aged 50-85 years, confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia, of which 1812 (55.2\%) completed the study. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (10 mg/kg target dose), or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; and biomarker endpoints. RESULTS EMERGE and ENGAGE were halted based on futility analysis of data pooled from the first approximately 50\% of enrolled patients; subsequent efficacy analyses included data from a larger data set collected up to futility declaration and followed prespecified statistical analyses. The primary endpoint was met in EMERGE (difference of -0.39 for high-dose aducanumab vs placebo [95\% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P=.012; 22\% decrease]) but not in ENGAGE (difference of 0.03, [95\% CI, -0.26 to 0.33; P=.833; 2\% increase]). Results of biomarker substudies confirmed target engagement and dose-dependent reduction in markers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The most common adverse event was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema. CONCLUSIONS Data from EMERGE demonstrated a statistically significant change across all four primary and secondary clinical endpoints. ENGAGE did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. A dose- and time-dependent reduction in pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease was observed in both trials.},

	abstract = {The proportion of older people in the population is increasing in almost every country. By 2050, around two billion people globally will be aged 60 years or over. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death among all diseases and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. It can be overwhelming not only for the person living with dementia, but also for carers, families and society as a whole. The alarming estimates of increasing numbers of people living with dementia worldwide, especially in lower income settings, cannot be ignored. Left unaddressed, such an increase would significantly undermine social and economic development globally. The COVID-19 pandemic presents health systems, economies and societies globally with an unprecedented challenge, particularly for older populations. Older populations are most at risk from severe disease and death from COVID-19, and for people living with dementia, the profound disruptions of the pandemic are even more acute. To achieve the goals of the Global action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017-2025, we need a concerted effort by all stakeholders to improve the lives of people with dementia and their families. We must work together as a global community, coordinating research efforts and leveraging the tools and knowledge at our disposal. WHO is fully committed to working with our Member States, civil society, the private sector and people living with dementia and their carers, to fulfil the targets in the Global dementia action plan. We are all ageing, and many of us will one day need services for dementia. Building the services and systems to prevent, delay and mitigate the effects of dementia and providing quality care for people with dementia and their families is essential now, and for the future in our ageing world.},

Since the original practice standards were published in 2004, new issues have emerged that need to be addressed: overuse of arrhythmia monitoring among a variety of patient populations, appropriate use of ischemia and QT-interval monitoring among select populations, alarm management, and documentation in electronic health records. METHODS Authors were commissioned by the American Heart Association and included experts from general cardiology, electrophysiology (adult and pediatric), and interventional cardiology, as well as a hospitalist and experts in alarm management. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Authors were assigned topics relevant to their areas of expertise, reviewed the literature with an emphasis on publications since the prior practice standards, and drafted recommendations on indications and duration for electrocardiographic monitoring in accordance with the American Heart Association Level of Evidence grading algorithm that was in place at the time of commissioning. RESULTS The comprehensive document is grouped into 5 sections: (1) Overview of Arrhythmia, Ischemia, and QTc Monitoring; (2) Recommendations for Indication and Duration of Electrocardiographic Monitoring presented by patient population; (3) Organizational Aspects: Alarm Management, Education of Staff, and Documentation; (4) Implementation of Practice Standards; and (5) Call for Research.

METHODS We randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, patients with Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias or motor fluctuations and motor impairment in the off-medication state to undergo either focused ultrasound ablation opposite the most symptomatic side of the body or a sham procedure. The primary outcome was a response at 3 months, defined as a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline either in the score on the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (MDS-UPDRS III), for the treated side in the off-medication state or in the score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) in the on-medication state. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to month 3 in the scores on various parts of the MDS-UPDRS. After the 3-month blinded phase, an open-label phase lasted until 12 months. RESULTS Of 94 patients, 69 were assigned to undergo ultrasound ablation (active treatment) and 25 to undergo the sham procedure (control); 65 patients and 22 patients, respectively, completed the primary-outcome assessment. In the active-treatment group, 45 patients (69\%) had a response, as compared with 7 (32\%) in the control group (difference, 37 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, 15 to 60; P = 0.003). Of the patients in the active-treatment group who had a response, 19 met the MDS-UPDRS III criterion only, 8 met the UDysRS criterion only, and 18 met both criteria. Results for secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as those for the primary outcome. Of the 39 patients in the active-treatment group who had had a response at 3 months and who were assessed at 12 months, 30 continued to have a response. Pallidotomy-related adverse events in the active-treatment group included dysarthria, gait disturbance, loss of taste, visual disturbance, and facial weakness. CONCLUSIONS Unilateral pallidal ultrasound ablation resulted in a higher percentage of patients who had improved motor function or reduced dyskinesia than a sham procedure over a period of 3 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the effect and safety of this technique in persons with Parkinson's disease. (Funded by Insightec; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03319485.).},

	abstract = {Background - A key to reduce and eradicate racial disparities in hypertension outcomes is to understand their causes. We aimed at evaluating racial differences in antihypertensive drug utilization patterns and blood pressure control by insurance status, age, sex, and presence of comorbidities. Methods and Results - A total of 8796 hypertensive individuals ≥18 years of age were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2012) in a repeated cross-sectional study. During the study period, all 3 racial groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics) experienced substantial increase in hypertension treatment and control. The overall treatment rates were 73.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 71.6\%-76.2\%), 70.8\% (95\% CI, 68.6\%-73.0\%), and 60.7\% (95\% CI, 57.0\%-64.3\%) and hypertension control rates were 42.9\% (95\% CI, 40.5\%-45.2\%), 36.9\% (95\% CI, 34.7\%-39.2\%), and 31.2\% (95\% CI, 28.6\%-33.9\%) for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectively. When stratified by insurance status, blacks (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% CI, 0.64-0.86] for insured and 0.59 [95\% CI, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) and Hispanics (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% CI, 0.60-0.91] for insured and 0.58 [95\% CI, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) persistently had lower rates of hypertension control compared with whites. Racial disparities also persisted in subgroups stratified by age (≥60 and {\textless}60 years of age) and presence of comorbidities but worsened among patients {\textless}60 years of age. Conclusions - Black and Hispanic patients had poorer hypertension control compared with whites, and these differences were more pronounced in younger and uninsured patients. Although black patients received more intensive antihypertensive therapy, Hispanics were undertreated. Future studies should further explore all aspects of these disparities to improve cardiovascular outcomes.},

DESIGN International prospective cohort study. SETTING 18 high, middle, and low income countries, sampled from urban and rural communities. PARTICIPANTS 103 570 people who provided morning fasting urine samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Association of estimated 24 hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion (surrogates for intake) with all cause mortality and major cardiovascular events, using multivariable Cox regression. A six category variable for joint sodium and potassium was generated: sodium excretion (low ({\textless}3 g/day), moderate (3-5 g/day), and high ({\textgreater}5 g/day) sodium intakes) by potassium excretion (greater/equal or less than median 2.1 g/day). RESULTS Mean estimated sodium and potassium urinary excretion were 4.93 g/day and 2.12 g/day, respectively. After a median follow-up of 8.2 years, 7884 (6.1\%) participants had died or experienced a major cardiovascular event. Increasing urinary sodium excretion was positively associated with increasing potassium excretion (unadjusted r=0.34), and only 0.002\% had a concomitant urinary excretion of {\textless}2.0 g/day of sodium and {\textgreater}3.5 g/day of potassium. A J-shaped association was observed of sodium excretion and inverse association of potassium excretion with death and cardiovascular events. For joint sodium and potassium excretion categories, the lowest risk of death and cardiovascular events occurred in the group with moderate sodium excretion (3-5 g/day) and higher potassium excretion (21.9\% of cohort). Compared with this reference group, the combinations of low potassium with low sodium excretion (hazard ratio 1.23, 1.11 to 1.37; 7.4\% of cohort) and low potassium with high sodium excretion (1.21, 1.11 to 1.32; 13.8\% of cohort) were associated with the highest risk, followed by low sodium excretion (1.19, 1.02 to 1.38; 3.3\% of cohort) and high sodium excretion (1.10, 1.02 to 1.18; 29.6\% of cohort) among those with potassium excretion greater than the median. Higher potassium excretion attenuated the increased cardiovascular risk associated with high sodium excretion (P for interaction=0.007). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the simultaneous target of low sodium intake ({\textless}2 g/day) with high potassium intake ({\textgreater}3.5 g/day) is extremely uncommon. Combined moderate sodium intake (3-5 g/day) with high potassium intake is associated with the lowest risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.},

Methods: The random sample of 4950 study participants aged 65 or more (age range 65-104 years), equally distributed in six age subgroups, and participated in cross-sectional, nationally representative survey PolSenior. During two separate visits, standardized interviews on awareness of hypertension as well as anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate readings were obtained. Hypertension was defined according to 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Results: Mean SBP was highest in men aged 75-79 years (148.3mmHg) and in women aged 80-84 years (149.9mmHg), and then steadily decreased, whereas DBP decreased steadily from age 65. Hypertension affected about 80\% of septuagenarians. Its prevalence decreased with age to 67\% in women and 60\% in men aged 90 years or older. In nonagenarians, awareness of hypertension (72\% in women and 61\% in men) and percentage of treated study participants (64\% of women and 54\% of men) was the lowest. In contrast, among treated study participants proportion of well controlled (BP{\textless}140/90mmHg) was the highest in people older than 85 reaching 34\% among nonagenarian women and 38\% in men. Conclusions: The results show a reversed trend in prevalence and control of hypertension in people aged 80 years and older when compared with the younger elderly. As awareness and treatment of hypertension decreases with advanced age, it seems reasonable to extend screening programs and antihypertensive initiatives for the elderly and very elderly.},

This study aimed to determine the effects of age, ethnicity, gender, education, marital status, nutritional parameters, and blood elements on the risk of high blood pressure in the Malaysian elderly. This research was conducted on a group of 2322 non-institutionalized Malaysian elderly. The hierarchy binary logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate the risk of hypertension in respondents. Approximately, 45.61\% of subjects had hypertension. The findings indicated that the female gender (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.54), an increase in body weight (OR = 1.61), and an increase in the blood levels of albumin (OR = 1.51), glucose (OR = 1.92), and triglycerides (OR = 1.27) significantly increased the risk of hypertension in subjects (p {\textless} 0.05). Conversely, an increase in both dietary carbohydrates (OR = 0.74), and blood cholesterol level (OR = 0.42) significantly reduced the risk of hypertension in samples (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the results showed that ethnicity was a non-relevant factor to increase the risk of hypertension in subjects. It was concluded that female gender, an increase in body weight, and an increase in the blood levels of glucose, triglycerides, and albumin enhanced the risk of high blood pressure in the Malaysian elderly.

We aimed to describe sex-stratified age-standardized estimates of prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension, and their associated factors in older adults. Methods: The KORA-Age1 is a population-based cross-sectional survey carried out in 2008/2009 on individuals aged 65-94 years in Augsburg region, Germany. Blood pressure measurements were available for 1052 out of 1079 persons who participated in the physical examination. Factors associated with prevalence, awareness and control of hypertension were investigated by multivariable logistic regression. Results: The overall prevalence of hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) was 73.8\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 69.3-77.9], representing 74.8\% (95\% CI, 68.4-80.2) in men and 73.5\% (95\% CI, 66.8-79.3) in women. Among those with hypertension, 80.2\% (95\% CI, 75.3-84.4) were aware of their hypertensive condition and 74.4\% (95\% CI, 69.2-79.1) were on treatment for hypertension. Among those aware of their hypertension status, 92.8\% (95\% CI, 88.8-95.6) were on treatment and 53.7\% (95\% CI, 47.0-60.1) had their blood pressure controlled. Hypertension was more frequent in individuals who were older, obese, or had diabetes. Higher education attainment or presence of comorbidities was associated with higher level of hypertension awareness. Individuals taking three antihypertensive drug classes were more likely to have controlled hypertension compared with those taking one antihypertensive drug class, odds ratio (OR), 1.85 (95\% CI, 1.14-2.99). Conclusion: Our findings identified high prevalence of hypertension and relevant health gaps on awareness, treatment and suboptimal control of hypertension in older adults in Germany. Screening for hypertension should especially target older adults with low educational attainment and 'healthy' elderly with less contact to physicians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-: Several factors predict functional status after stroke, but most studies have included hospitalized patients with limited follow-up. We hypothesized that patients with ischemic stroke experience functional decline over 5 years independent of recurrent stroke and other risk factors. METHODS-: In the population-based Northern Manhattan Study, patients ≥40 years of age with incident ischemic stroke were prospectively followed using the Barthel Index at 6 months and annually to 5 years. Baseline stroke severity was categorized as mild (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale {\textless}6), moderate (6 to 13), and severe (≥14). Follow-up was censored at death, recurrent stroke, or myocardial infarction. Generalized Estimating Equations provided ORs and 95\% CIs for predictors of favorable (Barthel Index ≥95) versus unfavorable (Barthel Index {\textless}95) functional status after adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors. RESULTS-: Of 525 patients, mean age was 68.6±12.4 years, 45.5\% were male, 54.7\% Hispanic, 54.7\% had Medicaid/no insurance, and 35.1\% had moderate stroke. The proportion with Barthel Index ≥95 declined over time (OR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 0.99). Changes in Barthel Index by insurance status were confirmed by a significant interaction term (β for interaction=-0.167, P=0.034); those with Medicaid/no insurance declined (OR, 0.84; P=0.003), whereas those with Medicare/private insurance did not (OR, 0.99; P=0.92). CONCLUSIONS-: The proportion of patients with functional independence after stroke declines annually for up to 5 years, and these effects are greatest for those with Medicaid or no health insurance. This decline is independent of age, stroke severity, and other predictors of functional decline and occurs even among those without recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction. © 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation is increasingly prevalent among older adults. It causes approximately 24\% of strokes in patients aged 80 to 89 years. The management of atrial fibrillation is directed at preventing thromboembolism and controlling the heart rate and rhythm. Stroke prevention is most effectively accomplished through administering anticoagulants such as warfarin, although older patients have higher hemorrhagic risk. Cognitive dysfunction, functional impairments, and increased fall risk further complicate warfarin management in elderly patients. The use of risk stratification schemes can help guide the anticoagulation decision, although the benefits of warfarin generally outweigh the risks in most older patients with atrial fibrillation. Pharmacologic rate control has been shown to result in similar outcomes compared with pharmacologic restoration of sinus rhythm and should be the initial therapy for elderly patients. Anti-arrhythmic medications should be selected based on an individual patient's coexisting medical conditions. In symptomatic patients who fail pharmacologic therapy, invasive strategies such as AV nodal ablation may help improve quality of life and symptoms, although such strategies do not obviate the need for antithrombotic therapy. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF) are 2 important public health priorities. Their prevalence is increasing worldwide, and the 2 conditions often coexist in the same patient. Hypertension and AF are strikingly related to an excess risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Hypertension ultimately increases the risk of AF, and because of its high prevalence in the population, it accounts for more cases of AF than other risk factors. Among patients with established AF, hypertension is present in about 60\% to 80\% of individuals. Despite the well-known association between hypertension and AF, several pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the higher risk of AF in hypertensive patients are still incompletely known. From an epidemiological standpoint, it is unclear whether the increasing risk of AF with blood pressure (BP) is linear or threshold. It is uncertain whether an intensive control of BP or the use of specific antihypertensive drugs, such as those inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reduces the risk of subsequent AF in hypertensive patients in sinus rhythm. Finally, in spite of the observational evidence suggesting a progressive relation between BP levels and the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with hypertension and AF, the extent to which BP should be lowered in these patients, including those who undergo catheter ablation, remains uncertain. This article summarizes the main basic mechanisms through which hypertension is believed to promote AF. It also explores epidemiological data supporting an evolutionary pathway from hypertension to AF, including the emerging evidence favoring an intensive BP control or the use of drugs, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to reduce the risk of AF. Finally, it examines the impact of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in relation to hypertension.},

The Netherlands Monitoring Project on Cardiovascular Risk Factors is a screening project that was carried out from 1987-1991 in three cities. Cross-sectional data were obtained on educational level and on the prevalence of smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and low HDL-cholesterol. A total of 36,000 men and women, aged 20-59 years participated. For all risk factors, except alcohol intake, a significant inverse association was found with educational level. Concurrence of risk factors was more prevalent in lower educated groups than in higher educated groups, but not more than can be expected under the condition of independence of the risk factors (no clustering). In conclusion, in the lower educated groups the prevalence of individual risk factors and of concurrence of risk factors was higher than in the higher educated groups. Concurrence of risk factors can have a synergistic effect on the risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore socioeconomic differences in risk factors may explain a greater part of the socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than is generally assumed.},

Hypertension, atherosclerosis, and resultant chronic heart failure reach epidemic proportions among older persons, and the clinical manifestations and the prognoses of these worsen with increasing age. The reason is that, in older individuals, specific pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie these diseases become superimposed on heart and vascular substrates that are modified by the process of aging. In other words, cardiovascular aging is risky. An understanding of how age, per se, modifies cardiovascular structure and function is critical to the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the older person.},

Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Spain. Participants: 4009 subjects representative of the Spanish non-institutionalised population aged 60 years and older. Main outcome measure: Prevalence of hypertension according to education and social class, and proportion of excess difference in hypertension prevalence in lower socioeconomic groups explained by different risk factors for hypertension. Results: The highest prevalence of hypertension was seen in subjects with less education and in those belonging to a low social class. In men, the hypertension risk factors analysed did not explain the difference in prevalence by education, but they explained almost half of the difference by social class. In women, these risk factors explained the differences in hypertension prevalence by education and a substantial part of the differences by social class. Central and general obesity, and physical inactivity were the risk factors that were the most important in this association in women. Conclusions: In women, socioeconomic position has no direct effect on hypertension in the case of education and only a small effect in the case of social class. In contrast, most of the effect of education and half of the effect of social class on hypertension in men is direct or, at least, is not explained by the risk factors analysed. The mechanisms that can explain the association between socioeconomic position and hypertension in older men remain to be established.},

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 7983 participants of the Rotterdam Study who were {\textgreater}/=55 years old and living in a district of Rotterdam. The prevalence of hypertension was based on blood pressure levels ({\textgreater}/=160/95 mm Hg) and the use of blood pressure-lowering medication for the indication of hypertension, type of treatment, and control of hypertension. Systolic blood pressure rises with age, whereas diastolic blood pressure declines. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age and was higher among women (39\%) than among men (31\%). About 80\% of the hypertensives were aware of having hypertension, and 82\% of the 80\% were treated. For 70\% of them, treatment was adequate with reference to conservative criteria. Hypertension was more prevalent among persons not living in a home for the elderly, for more-educated men, and for less-educated women. Persons without a partner and men living in a home for the elderly had a higher risk of being unaware of or of not being treated for existing hypertension. Treatment was more often successful among those living in a home for the elderly. The prevalence of hypertension was higher among older women and increased with age in both genders. A large proportion of hypertensive elderly persons were aware and were successfully treated for hypertension. The degree of awareness and control appeared to be affected by sociodemographic factors. More importantly, the majority of hypertensives did not have their hypertension well controlled. This group requires more attention by medical practitioners to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases in elderly persons.},

Design: The Three City study, a population-based study among 9693 non-institutionalized individuals aged 65 years and over. Methods: Blood pressure was measured with an automated electronic device, and treatment assessed, during home interview. Hypertension was defined by a mean blood pressure of two measurements superior to or equal to 160/ 95 mmHg and/or the intake of antihypertensive medications. Results: In the final working sample of 9090 people, 62\% were hypertensive. More than two-thirds were aware of their hypertension and 81\% were treated with antihypertensive drugs. Among 4573 treated hypertensive participants, 35\% had a blood pressure over 160/95 mmHg and 69\% over 140/90 mmHg. Women were more frequently aware of their hypertension, more frequently treated, and more frequently controlled than men. A history of cardiovascular disease, high body mass index, diabetes and high frequency of visits to the general practitioner were related to higher percentages of awareness and treatment. Among treated hypertensive patients, those with a history of cardiovascular events or who visited their general practitioner more often or who more often had their blood pressure measured were more frequently controlled. Awareness was strongly associated with treatment, but was inversely related to control of hypertension among treated hypertensive patients. Conclusions: Management of hypertension, and particularly its control among treated hypertensive patients, needs to be improved in people aged 65 years and over. © 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Guidelines summarize and evaluate all evidence available, at the time of the writing process, on a particular issue with the aim of assisting physicians in selecting the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition, taking into account the impact on outcome, as well as the risk–benefit ratio of particular diagnostic or therapeutic means. Guidelines are not substitutes but are complements for textbooks, and cover the ESC Core Curriculum topics. Guidelines and recommendations should help physicians to make decisions in their daily practice: however, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible physician(s). A great number of Guidelines have been issued in recent years by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of the impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines-surveys/esc-guidelines/about/Pages/rules-writing.aspx). ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated. Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for the diagnosis, management and/or prevention of a given condition according to the ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Estimates of expected health outcomes for larger populations were included, where data exist. The level of evidence and the strength of recommendation of particular treatment options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2. The experts of the writing and reviewing panels completed Declaration of Interest forms where real or potential sources of conflicts of interest might be perceived. These forms were compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period must be notified to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the ESC, without any involvement from healthcare industry. The ESC CPG supervises and co-ordinates the preparation of new Guidelines produced by Task Forces, expert groups or consensus panels. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions, they are approved by all the experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The task of developing ESC Guidelines covers not only the integration of the most recent research, but also the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations. To implement the guidelines, condensed pocket editions, summary slides, booklets with essential messages, electronic versions for digital applications (smartphones etc.) are produced. These versions are abridged and thus, if needed, one should always refer to the full text version, which is freely available on the ESC website. The National Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, translate and implement the ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations. Surveys and registries are needed to verify that real-life daily practice is in keeping with what is recommended in the guidelines, thus completing the loop between clinical research, writing of guidelines and implementing them into clinical practice. The Guidelines do not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and necessary, the patient's guardian or carer. It is also the health professional's responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE The aim of the Medicine use and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) study is to investigate the changes in medication and healthcare service use among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medications in this group. This is important, because the number of persons with AD is rapidly growing and even though they are a particularly vulnerable patient group, the number of representative, large-scale studies with adequate follow-up time is limited. PARTICIPANTS MEDALZ contains all residents of Finland who received a clinically verified diagnosis of AD between 2005 and 2011 and were community-dwelling at the time of diagnosis (N=70 719). The diagnosis is based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCS-ADRDA) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for Alzheimer's disease. The cohort contains socioeconomic data (education, occupational status and taxable income, 1972-2012) and causes of death (2005-2012), data from the prescription register (1995-2012), the special reimbursement register (1972-2012) and the hospital discharge register (1972-2012). Future updates are planned.The average age was 80.1 years (range 34.5-104.6 years). The majority of cohort (65.2\%) was women. Currently, the average length of follow-up after AD diagnosis is 3.1 years and altogether 26 045 (36.8\%) persons have died during the follow-up. FINDINGS Altogether 53\% of the cohort had used psychotropic drugs within 1 year after AD diagnoses. The initiation rate of for example, benzodiazepines and related drugs and antidepressants began to increase already before AD diagnosis. FUTURE PLANS We are currently assessing if these, and other commonly used medications are related to adverse events such as death, hip fractures, head injuries and pneumonia.},

DESIGN Systematic review and Bayesian network metaanalysis (NMA). SETTING MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Ageline (inception-March 2016). PARTICIPANTS Individuals with AD in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and nonrandomized studies. INTERVENTION Any combination of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine. MEASUREMENTS Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts; abstracted data; and appraised risk of bias. RESULTS Twenty thousand three hundred forty-three citations were screened, and 142 studies were included (110 RCTs, 21 non-RCTs, 11 cohort studies). NMA found that donepezil (Mini-Mental State Examination: mean difference (MD) = 1.39, 95\% credible interval (CrI) = 0.53-2.24), donepezil+memantine (2.59, 95\% CrI = 0.12-4.98), and transdermal rivastigmine (2.02, 95\% CrI = 0.02-4.08) improved cognition more than placebo. NMA found that donepezil (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive: MD = -3.29, 95\% CrI = -4.57 to -1.99) and galantamine (MD = -2.13, 95\% CrI = -3.91 to -0.27) improved cognition more than placebo. NMA found that donepezil+memantine (MD = -5.23, 95\% CrI = -8.72 to -1.56) improved behavior more than placebo. NMA found that donepezil (MD = -0.32, 95\% CrI = -0.46 to -0.19), donepezil+memantine (MD = -0.57, 95\% CrI = -0.95 to -0.21), oral rivastigmine (MD = -0.38, 95\% CrI = -0.56 to -0.17), and galantamine (MD = -3.79, 95\% CrI = -6.98 to -0.59) improved global status more than placebo. NMA found that galantamine decreased the odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.56, 95\% CrI = 0.36-0.87). No agent increased risk of serious adverse events, falls, or bradycardia. Some increased risk of headache (oral rivastigmine), diarrhea (oral rivastigmine, donepezil), nausea (oral rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine), and vomiting (oral rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine). CONCLUSION An exhaustive review of the literature involving 142 studies demonstrated that cognitive enhancers in general have minimal effects on cognition according to minimal clinically important difference and global ratings. The drugs appear safe, but this must be interpreted cautiously because trial participants may have less comorbidity and fewer adverse effects than those treated with these drugs in clinical practice.},

The electrocardiographs (ECGs) and blood pressures were recorded at the baseline and 4 weeks after the dose of 10 mg/d of donepezil, 10 cm(2)/d of rivastigmine, and 24 mg/d of galantamine. RESULTS There were no changes relative to the baseline in any of the ECG parameters or arterial blood pressure with any of the administered ChEIs.

We treated her with potassium chloride and started magnesium sulfate and lidocaine, and then added isoprenaline injection. After these treatments, her heart rate increased and we did not detect TdP again. With the aging population in Japan, prescriptions for donepezil are increasing.

However, AChIs are usually associated with peripheral adverse reactions. Here, we investigated the cardiac outcomes in elderly AD patients treated with donepezil. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 82 AD patients (age, 75.47 ± 6.53 years) received 5 mg or 10 mg donepezil (n = 41/group) once daily for 12 weeks. Next, we examined the heart rate (HR), cardiac rhythm, and PR, QRS, and QTc intervals. RESULTS Compared to the 5-mg donepezil-treated group, the HR was slower in the 10-mg donepezil-treated group at the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of treatment (p = 0.041, 0.026, 0.008, respectively). The PR interval was longer in the 10-mg donepezil-treated group at the 12th week of treatment (p = 0.022). Compared to the pretreatment values, the post-treatment HR and PR interval in the 10-mg donepezil-treated group were significantly slower and longer, respectively (p = 0.002, p = 0.005). Further, the HR was significantly correlated to the donepezil dosage (p = 0.014). Similarly, donepezil dosage and treatment interval were significantly correlated (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION Taken together, our findings suggest that 10 mg donepezil decreased the HR of elderly AD patients without inducing severe cardiac outcomes. Therefore, AD patients receiving donepezil should undergo regular cardiovascular monitoring. .},

	abstract = {In this review, the basic mechanism of the parasympathetic nervous effect on the heart is discussed. This is expanded to clinical situations to clarify what can happen to patients after cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor is administered and to avoid unnecessary adverse effects. The parasympathetic nervous system can affect heart as well as brain function, and its effect on the heart is more complicated than is generally thought. The best-known effect is the cardioinhibitory effect, i.e. slowing of the heart rate. Its effect is also very sensitive to the time at which the stimulus falls within the cardiac cycle (phase-dependent effect). On some occasions, a cardiostimulatory effect can be observed. The parasympathetic nervous system also interacts with the sympathetic nervous system (sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction). ChE inhibitors or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often being administered to improve cognitive function of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The heart is naturally rich with ChE, and its inhibition may affect cardiac function, especially in elderly patients, many of whom have concomitant cardiovascular disease. Inhibition of ChE retards ACh degradation and potentiates the cardioinhibitory effect. However, the effect of ChE inhibitor is only slight in patients that receive a typical dose. After administration of ChE inhibitor in humans, the phase-dependent effect is reduced because the parasympathetic nervous effect is potentiated and saturated (saturation mechanism). Beat-by-beat fluctuation is reduced. ChE inhibitor increases arterial blood pressure through central M1 and M2 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (Br J Pharmacol 127:1657-1665, 1999). However, diastolic blood pressure increases slightly.},

These drugs enhance the effects of acetylcholine, and reports suggest they may precipitate bradycardia in some patients. We aimed to examine the association between use of cholinesterase inhibitors and hospitalization for bradycardia. METHODS AND FINDINGS We examined the health care records of more than 1.4 million older adults using a case-time-control design, allowing each individual to serve as his or her own control. Case patients were residents of Ontario, Canada, aged 67 y or older hospitalized for bradycardia between January 1, 2003 and March 31, 2008. Control patients (3:1) were not hospitalized for bradycardia, and were matched to the corresponding case on age, sex, and a disease risk index. All patients had received cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in the 9 mo preceding the index hospitalization. We identified 1,009 community-dwelling older persons hospitalized for bradycardia within 9 mo of using a cholinesterase inhibitor. Of these, 161 cases informed the matched analysis of discordant pairs. Of these, 17 (11\%) required a pacemaker during hospitalization, and six (4\%) died prior to discharge. After adjusting for temporal changes in drug utilization, hospitalization for bradycardia was associated with recent initiation of a cholinesterase inhibitor (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.13, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-3.51). The risk was similar among individuals with pre-existing cardiac disease (adjusted OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.18-4.28) and those receiving negative chronotropic drugs (adjusted OR 2.34, 95\% CI 1.16-4.71). We found no such association when we replicated the analysis using proton pump inhibitors as a neutral exposure. Despite hospitalization for bradycardia, more than half of the patients (78 of 138 cases [57\%]) who survived to discharge subsequently resumed cholinesterase inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSIONS Among older patients, initiation of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy was associated with a more than doubling of the risk of hospitalization for bradycardia. Resumption of therapy following discharge was common, suggesting that the cardiovascular toxicity of cholinesterase inhibitors is underappreciated by clinicians.},

SETTING New England Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. PARTICIPANTS Patients with dementia who received care between January 1999 and June 2007 (N=11,328). MEASUREMENTS Bradycardia was defined using three methods using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes and recorded heart rates of less than 60 beats per minute. RESULTS A greater risk for bradycardia was found in patients taking any ChE-Is than in the no-treatment group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-1.6). A dose-response effect was observed for donepezil, with the highest-dose group at greatest risk (HR=2.1, 95\% CI=1.5-2.9). Results were consistent regardless of bradycardia definition. Patients with bradycardia were more likely to fall, experience syncope, or need a pacemaker implantation than those without. CONCLUSION Using a large cohort, a modestly greater risk of bradycardia was found in patients with dementia taking ChE-Is than in those not taking these drugs. In patients taking donepezil, the risk of bradycardia may increase with increasing doses. Because of the potential clinical consequences, monitoring for bradycardia may be warranted in patients with dementia treated with ChE-Is.},

RESULTS Hospital visits for syncope were more frequent in people receiving cholinesterase inhibitors than in controls (31.5 vs 18.6 events per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-1.98). Other syncope-related events were also more common among people receiving cholinesterase inhibitors compared with controls: hospital visits for bradycardia (6.9 vs 4.4 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.32-2.15), permanent pacemaker insertion (4.7 vs 3.3 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.49; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.00), and hip fracture (22.4 vs 19.8 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.34). Results were consistent in additional analyses in which subjects were either matched on their baseline comorbidity status or matched using propensity scores. CONCLUSIONS Use of cholinesterase inhibitors is associated with increased rates of syncope, bradycardia, pacemaker insertion, and hip fracture in older adults with dementia. The risk of these previously underrecognized serious adverse events must be weighed carefully against the drugs' generally modest benefits.},

	abstract = {The autonomic nervous system is an important modulator of cardiac signaling in both health and disease. In fact, the significance of altered parasympathetic tone in cardiac disease has recently come to the forefront. Both neuronal and nonneuronal cholinergic signaling likely play a physiological role, since modulating acetylcholine (ACh) signaling from neurons or cardiomyocytes appears to have significant consequences in both health and disease. Notably, many of these effects are solely due to changes in cholinergic signaling, without altered sympathetic drive, which is known to have significant adverse effects in disease states. As such, it is likely that enhanced ACh-mediated signaling not only has direct positive effects on cardiomyocytes, but it also offsets the negative effects of hyperadrenergic tone. In this review, we discuss recent studies that implicate ACh as a major regulator of cardiac remodeling and provide support for the notion that enhancing cholinergic signaling in human patients with cardiac disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. These recent results support the idea of developing large clinical trials of strategies to increase cholinergic tone, either by stimulating the vagus or by increased availability of Ach, in heart failure.},

Although approved only as symptomatic therapies, recent studies suggest that long-term use of these drugs may also have disease-modifying benefits.

	doi = {10.1111/jgs.15810},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exponential increase in the number of medications associated with clinically important prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) places older adults at increased risk of arrhythmias including life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden death. Risk factors, other than age older than 65 years and female sex, include multiple concurrent drugs that prolong QTc and a variety of underlying predisposing conditions. Although electronic medical records and pharmacy dispensing systems can alert clinicians to the risk of QTc-prolonging therapy, more than 95\% of safety alerts are overridden, and many systems have deactivated QTc drug interaction alerts. The clinical consequences, magnitude of the effect, mitigation strategies, and recommended monitoring are not well defined for nursing facility (NF) residents. DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING: NFs in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: NF residents. RESULTS: Medications known to prolong QTc include selected anti-infectives, antidepressants, urinary anticholinergics, antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil), used commonly in NFs. Drug-drug interactions are a risk when adding a medication that exaggerates the effect or inhibits the metabolism of a QTc-prolonging medication. The vast majority of patients in whom TdP is induced by noncardiac drugs have risk factors that are easily identifiable. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are provided to improve standardization and use of drug interaction alerts, evaluate the risk of QTc-prolonging drugs in older adults receiving generally lower doses, validate a QTc risk score addressing complex multimorbidity, garner evidence to guide clinical decision making, avail NFs of access to electrocardiograms and interpretive recommendations, and develop standards of practice for hosting risk discussions with residents and their families.

	abstract = {Background: Several psychoactive medications are known to cause QTc prolongation. Patient factors also increase the risk for QTc prolongation, including bradycardia, female sex, older age, metabolic abnormalities, and polypharmacy. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, prolongs the QTc interval through a multimodal mechanism. Patient History: A 26-year-old African American female was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt that was not an overdose. Past medical history was significant for major depression, traumatic brain injury, seizures, hemiplegia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and tachycardia. Two baseline electrocardiograms (EKGs) were obtained showing normal QTc intervals. After several weeks, donepezil (5 mg by mouth once daily) was initiated for cognitive rehabilitation and titrated over 3 weeks to a dose of 20 mg. An EKG performed after the last dose change showed a prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Another follow-up EKG performed 9 days later showed further prolongation to 528 ms. Laboratory values were within normal limits during her hospital stay. Donepezil was discontinued completely, leading to normalization of the QTc interval. Discussion: QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes have been identified in postmarketing case reports of donepezil. Instances of QTc prolongation have predominantly been documented in the geriatric population, primarily in those with additional risk factors. Additionally, current literature does not support the use of donepezil for neurocognitive rehabilitation in daily doses exceeding 10 mg. A temporal and causal relationship was observed between the initiation and titration of donepezil and development of QTc prolongation.},

For individuals, a significant, positive, independent linear relation between 24-h sodium excretion and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found. With multivariate adjustment for underestimation, the estimated effect of a sodium intake higher by 100 mmol/d was higher SBP/DBP (diastolic blood pressure) by approximately 3-6/0-3 mm Hg. This relation prevailed for both men and women, for younger and older people, and for 8344 people without hypertension. In tests of prior cross-population hypotheses (n = 52), significant, independent relations were found between sample 24-h median urinary sodium excretion and sample median SBP and DBP, prevalence rate of hypertension, and slope of SBP and DBP from age 20 to 59 y (median sodium intake greater by 100 mmol/d was associated with a 30-y increase in SBP/DBP, i.e., at the age of 55 y compared with 25 y, of 10-11/6 mm Hg.

Methods: A cohort of 4630 individuals aged 25–64 years collected 24-h urine samples in 1979–2002 and were followed up to 14 years for the incidence of any CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure (HF) and DM event, and death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between the baseline salt intake and incident events and adjusted for baseline age, body mass index, serum cholesterol, prevalent DM, and stratified by sex and cohort baseline year. Results: During the follow-up, we observed 423 deaths, 424 CVD events (288 CHD events, 142 strokes, 139 HF events) and 161 DM events. Compared with the highest quartile of salt intake, persons in the lowest quartile had a lower incidence of CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.51–0.95, p =.02), CHD (HR 0.63 [95\% CI 0.42–0.94], p =.02) and DM (HR 0.52 [95\% CI 0.31–0.87], p =.01).

The Cn for prevalence of HTN was -0.084. Two factors, age (58.46\%) and wealth (32.40\%), contributed most to the socioeconomic inequality in the prevalence of HTN. Conclusion: The prevalence of HTN was higher among low-SES individuals, who also showed higher levels of awareness. However, treatment and control of HTN were more concentrated among those who had higher levels of SES, indicating that people at a higher risk of adverse event related to HTN (the low SES individuals) are not benefiting from the advantage of treatment and control of HTN.

However, the impact of SES on hypertension has been reported in several studies with conflicting results. METHODS A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Proquest and Cochrane databases for observational studies on hypertension prevalence and SES, published in English, until March 2014. Hypertension was defined as a mean SBP of at least 140 mmHg or a DBP of at least 90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. The inverse variance method with a random-effects model was used to pool the risk estimates from the individual studies. Data abstraction was conducted independently by two authors. RESULTS Among the 2404 references, 51 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An overall increased risk of hypertension among the lowest SES was found for all three indicators: income [pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.48], occupation (pooled OR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.04-1.64) and education (pooled OR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.55-2.63). The associations were significant in high-income countries, and the increased risk of hypertension for the lowest categories of all SES indicators was most evident for women, whereas men revealed less consistent associations. CONCLUSION Low SES is associated with higher blood pressure, and this association is particularly evident in the level of education. It is important to identify and monitor hypertension to reduce the risk of this disease among the most vulnerable groups in different countries and among different societies.},

This book proposes a systematic approach to building such models based on standard principles of statistical modeling. The main emphasis is on the fractional polynomial method for modeling the influence of continuous variables in a multivariable context, a topic for which there is no standard approach. Existing options range from very simple step functions to highly complex adaptive methods such as multivariate splines with many knots and penalisation. This new approach, developed in part by the authors over the last decade, is a compromise which promotes interpretable, comprehensible and transportable models.},

	abstract = {Background: The neurocognitive benefits of donepezil are well recognised, but the potential side effects on cardiac conduction remain unclear. Objective: To investigate whether long-term donepezil therapy is associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and in particular to assess its effects on the QT interval. Methods: We conducted a single centre retrospective analysis of patients admitted to our trust on donepezil therapy over a 12-month period. An admission resting 12-lead ECG was obtained and compared to their ECG prior to commencement of donepezil therapy to assess for any significant difference in ECG parameters. Results: We identified 59 patients suitable for analysis. PR (177.0 ± 29.0 ms vs. 186.1 ± 34.2 ms, p = 0.04), QRS (101.7 ± 20.3 ms vs. 104.7 ± 22.3 ms, p = 0.04) and QT (393.3 ± 35.6 ms vs. 411.9 ± 44.6 ms, p = 0.002) interval prolongation were all associated with donepezil use. The increase in QT intervals remained significant on correction for heart rate; resulting in 8 (13.6\%) patients developing high arrhythmogenic risk based on assessment using QT nomogram plots. Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants was associated with significant QT prolongation (QTcB: r pb = 0.344, p = 0.008, QTcFred: r pb = 0.382, p = 0.003, QTcFram: r pb = 0.379, p = 0.003, QTcH: r pb = 0.352, p = 0.006), while the use of rate-limiting calcium channel blockers was associated with significant PR prolongation (r pb = 0.314, p = 0.030), and beta-blockers with a reduction in heart rate (r pb = 0.256, p = 0.050). Conclusion: Our results clearly demonstrate that long-term use of donepezil is associated with prolongation of the QT interval. We suggest ECG evaluation should take place before and after donepezil initiation, and clinicians should be even more vigilant in those prescribed tricyclic antidepressants.},

	abstract = {In randomized clinical trials (RCT), the analysis is based on the intent-to-treat principle to avoid any selection bias in the constitution of groups. However, estimates of overall survival can be biased when significant crossover occurs because the separation of randomized groups is lost. To handle these switches, the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) method has been proposed; however, it is still poorly used in RCT, notably because of its complex implementation. In particular, for time-to-event outcomes, it can be difficult to format data, especially when time-dependent covariates have to be managed, with different measurement times between patients. This paper aims to present the R package ipcwswitch with some guidance for the analysis of the treatment effect on survival in a hypothetical setting where all patients would have continued to take the randomization treatment. After a brief recall of the key principles of the IPCW method, each step of the implementation is described using a toy example. The guidelines are illustrated in a case study that aimed at evaluating the benefit of therapy based on tumour molecular profiling for advanced cancers, SHIVA01.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Higher levels of sodium intake are reported to be associated with higher blood pressure. Whether this relationship varies according to levels of sodium or potassium intake and in different populations is unknown. METHODS We studied 102,216 adults from 18 countries. Estimates of 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion were made from a single fasting morning urine specimen and were used as surrogates for intake. We assessed the relationship between electrolyte excretion and blood pressure, as measured with an automated device. RESULTS Regression analyses showed increments of 2.11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.78 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure for each 1-g increment in estimated sodium excretion. The slope of this association was steeper with higher sodium intake (an increment of 2.58 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure per gram for sodium excretion {\textgreater}5 g per day, 1.74 mm Hg per gram for 3 to 5 g per day, and 0.74 mm Hg per gram for {\textless}3 g per day; P{\textless}0.001 for interaction). The slope of association was steeper for persons with hypertension (2.49 mm Hg per gram) than for those without hypertension (1.30 mm Hg per gram, P{\textless}0.001 for interaction) and was steeper with increased age (2.97 mm Hg per gram at {\textgreater}55 years of age, 2.43 mm Hg per gram at 45 to 55 years of age, and 1.96 mm Hg per gram at {\textless}45 years of age; P{\textless}0.001 for interaction). Potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure, with a steeper slope of association for persons with hypertension than for those without it (P{\textless}0.001) and a steeper slope with increased age (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this study, the association of estimated intake of sodium and potassium, as determined from measurements of excretion of these cations, with blood pressure was nonlinear and was most pronounced in persons consuming high-sodium diets, persons with hypertension, and older persons.

Our purpose is to assess the association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. Spot urine and blood pressure were collected annually during a 5-year period from 4360 Japanese workers with ages ranging from 19 to 55 years. Estimates of 24-h sodium and potassium excretion were based on Tanaka's formula. Overall, a single standard deviation increase in the estimated sodium excretion (36.5 mmol/day) was associated with a 1.3 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure and a 0.8 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (P {\textless} 0.001). A single standard deviation increase in estimated potassium excretion (8.9 mmol/day) was associated with a 1.1 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure and a 0.7 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure (P {\textless} 0.001). As a combined measure of the excretion of both electrolytes, the estimated 24-h sodium-to-potassium ratio was positively associated with both blood pressures (P {\textless} 0.001). Associations of blood pressure with sodium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio increased with age and were stronger in men compared to women. Associations with potassium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio were stronger in individuals who were overweight. The findings provide evidence for an association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. As convenient measures of dietary intake for each electrolyte, repeated spot urine samples may be useful for assessing hypertension risk, especially in men, older individuals, and overweight individuals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The high diabetes incidence among Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians cannot be explained by BMI. Therefore, we examined the influence of three dietary patterns of "fat and meat," "vegetables," and "fruit and milk" on diabetes risk in the Hawaii component of the Multiethnic Cohort with 29,759 Caucasians, 35,244 Japanese Americans, and 10,509 Native Hawaiians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subjects aged 45-75 years completed a baseline food frequency questionnaire. After 14 years of follow-up, 8,587 subjects with incident diabetes were identified through self-reports or health plan linkages. Risk was assessed using Cox regression stratified by age and adjusted for ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, education, total energy, smoking, alcohol intake, marital status, and hypertension. RESULTS Fat and meat was significantly associated with diabetes risk in men (hazard ratio 1.40 [95\% CI 1.23-1.60], P(trend) {\textless} 0.0001) and women (1.22 [1.06-1.40], P(trend) = 0.004) when extreme quintiles were compared. Except in Hawaiian women, the magnitude of the risk was similar across ethnic groups although not always significant. After stratification by BMI, fat and meat remained a predictor of disease primarily among overweight men and among overweight Japanese women. Vegetables lowered diabetes risk in men (0.86 [0.77-0.95], P(trend) = 0.004) but not in women, whereas fruit and milk seemed to be more beneficial in women (0.85 [0.76-0.96], P(trend) = 0.005) than in men (0.92 [0.83-1.02], P(trend) = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Foods high in meat and fat appear to confer a higher diabetes risk in all ethnic groups, whereas the effects of other dietary patterns vary by sex and ethnicity.},

Continuous exposures are commonly discretized when the outcome is nonlinearly related to exposure as well as to facilitate interpretation and reduce measurement error. Guidance is needed regarding statistically valid trend tests for epidemiological data of this nature. Methods: The association between a discretized variable and a disease is modeled through logistic regression or survival analysis. Linear regression is then conducted by regressing the odds ratio or relative risk on the midpoint of the exposure interval. The trend test is based on the slope of the regression line. In order to investigate the performance of this approach, we conducted simulation studies, considering ten different approaches for the linear regression based on the inclusion or exclusion of an intercept in the model and the form of the weights. The proposed methods are applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 for illustration. Results: The simulation studies show that eight of these methods are valid, and the relative efficiency depends on the underlying relationship between the covariate and the outcome. Conclusions: The significance of the study is its potential to help practitioners select an appropriate method to test for trend in their future studies that utilize ordinal covariates.},

We studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium, in conjunction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products, in persons with and in those without hypertension. METHODS A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet typical of intake in the United States or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high, intermediate, and low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in random order. RESULTS Reducing the sodium intake from the high to the intermediate level reduced the systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.001) during the control diet and by 1.3 mm Hg (P=0.03) during the DASH diet. Reducing the sodium intake from the intermediate to the low level caused additional reductions of 4.6 mm Hg during the control diet (P{\textless}0.001) and 1.7 mm Hg during the DASH diet (P{\textless}0.01). The effects of sodium were observed in participants with and in those without hypertension, blacks and those of other races, and women and men. The DASH diet was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level; and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones. As compared with the control diet with a high sodium level, the DASH diet with a low sodium level led to a mean systolic blood pressure that was 7.1 mm Hg lower in participants without hypertension, and 11.5 mm Hg lower in participants with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS The reduction of sodium intake to levels below the current recommendation of 100 mmol per day and the DASH diet both lower blood pressure substantially, with greater effects in combination than singly. Long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of people to make long-lasting dietary changes and the increased availability of lower-sodium foods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The relationship between dietary sodium intake and blood pressure (BP) has been tested in clinical trials and nonexperimental human studies, indicating a direct association. The exact shape of the dose-response relationship has been difficult to assess in clinical trials because of the lack of random-effects dose-response statistical models that can include 2-arm comparisons. METHODS After performing a comprehensive literature search for experimental studies that investigated the BP effects of changes in dietary sodium intake, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis using the new 1-stage cubic spline mixed-effects model. We included trials with at least 4 weeks of follow-up; 24-hour urinary sodium excretion measurements; sodium manipulation through dietary change or supplementation, or both; and measurements of systolic and diastolic BP at the beginning and end of treatment. RESULTS We identified 85 eligible trials with sodium intake ranging from 0.4 to 7.6 g/d and follow-up from 4 weeks to 36 months. The trials were conducted in participants with hypertension (n=65), without hypertension (n=11), or a combination (n=9). Overall, the pooled data were compatible with an approximately linear relationship between achieved sodium intake and mean systolic as well as diastolic BP, with no indication of a flattening of the curve at either the lowest or highest levels of sodium exposure. Results were similar for participants with or without hypertension, but the former group showed a steeper decrease in BP after sodium reduction. Intervention duration (≥12 weeks versus 4 to 11 weeks), type of study design (parallel or crossover), use of antihypertensive medication, and participants' sex had little influence on the BP effects of sodium reduction. Additional analyses based on the BP effect of difference in sodium exposure between study arms at the end of the trial confirmed the results on the basis of achieved sodium intake. CONCLUSIONS In this dose-response analysis of sodium reduction in clinical trials, we identified an approximately linear relationship between sodium intake and reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP across the entire range of dietary sodium exposure. Although this occurred independently of baseline BP, the effect of sodium reduction on level of BP was more pronounced in participants with a higher BP level.},

We examined the association between sodium concentration in spot urine, a validated index of sodium excretion occurring over 24-h, and blood pressure changes between baseline and follow-up survey in all, non-overweight (body mass index(BMI) ≤ 25 kg/m(2)) and overweight normotensives. RESULTS For all subjects, sodium concentrations in spot urine were not associated with either systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes. When stratified by BMI at baseline survey, sodium concentrations were positively associated with systolic blood pressure changes in non-overweight subjects, but not in overweight subjects. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, alcohol intake status, current smoking and estimated glomerular filtration rate, the multivariable-adjusted mean values of the systolic blood pressure change among non-overweight subjects was +7.3 mmHg in the highest quartiles of sodium concentrations, while it was +3.9 mmHg in the lowest quartile (P for difference = 0.021, P for trend = 0.040). After further adjustment of baseline blood pressure levels, the association was slightly weakened; the multivariable-adjusted mean values of the systolic blood pressure changes were +7.0 mmHg and +4.2 mmHg (P for difference = 0.047, P for trend = 0.071).

	abstract = {In numerous epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental studies, dietary sodium intake has been linked to blood pressure, and a reduction in dietary salt intake has been documented to lower blood pressure. In young subjects, salt intake has a programming effect in that blood pressure remains elevated even after a high salt intake has been reduced. Elderly subjects, African Americans, and obese patients are more sensitive to the blood pressure-lowering effects of a decreased salt intake. Depending on the baseline blood pressure and degree of salt intake reduction, systolic blood pressure can be lowered by 4 to 8 mm Hg. A greater decrease in blood pressure is achieved when a reduced salt intake is combined with other lifestyle interventions, such as adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. A high salt intake has been shown to increase not only blood pressure but also the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, and proteinuria. Adverse effects associated with salt intake reduction, unless excessive, seem to be minimal. However, data linking a decreased salt intake to a decrease in morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients are not unanimous. Dietary salt intake reduction can delay or prevent the incidence of antihypertensive therapy, can facilitate blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients receiving medical therapy, and may represent a simple cost-saving mediator to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Available data indicate that dietary sodium (as salt) relates directly to blood pressure (BP). Most of these findings are from studies lacking dietary data; hence, it is unclear whether this sodium-BP relationship is modulated by other dietary factors. With control for multiple nondietary factors, but not body mass index, there were direct relations to BP of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and the urinary sodium/potassium ratio among 4680 men and women 40 to 59 years of age (17 population samples in China, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States) in the INTERMAP (International Study on Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure), and among its 2195 American participants, for example, 2 SD higher 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (118.7 mmol) associated with systolic BP 3.7 mm Hg higher. These sodium-BP relations persisted with control for 13 macronutrients, 12 vitamins, 7 minerals, and 18 amino acids, for both sex, older and younger, blacks, Hispanics, whites, and socioeconomic strata. With control for body mass index, sodium-BP-but not sodium/potassium-BP-relations were attenuated. Normal weight and obese participants manifested significant positive relations to BP of urinary sodium; relations were weaker for overweight people. At lower but not higher levels of 24-hour sodium excretion, potassium intake blunted the sodium-BP relation. The adverse association of dietary sodium with BP is minimally attenuated by other dietary constituents; these findings underscore the importance of reducing salt intake for the prevention and control of prehypertension and hypertension.

	abstract = {UNLABELLED No previous study has investigated dietary pattern in association with obesity risk in a middle-aged Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations between dietary patterns and the risk of obesity in the city of Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, east China. In this cross-sectional study of 2560 subjects aged 45-60 years, dietary intakes were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). All anthropometric measurements were obtained using standardized procedures. The partial correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between dietary patterns and body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between dietary patterns and obesity, with adjustment for potential confounders. Four major dietary patterns were extracted by means of factor analysis: animal food, traditional Chinese, western fast-food, and high-salt patterns. The animal food pattern was positively associated with BMI (r = 0.082, 0.144, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05) and WC (r = 0.102, 0.132, respectively, p {\textless} 0.01), and the traditional Chinese pattern was inversely associated with BMI (r = -0.047, -0.116, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05) and WC (r = -0.067, -0.113, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05) in both genders. After controlling for potential confounders, subjects in the highest quartile of animal food pattern scores had a greater odds ratio for abdominal obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.188-2.340; p {\textless} 0.01), in comparison to those from the lowest quartile. Compared with the lowest quartile of the traditional Chinese pattern, the highest quartile had a lower odds ratio for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.63; 95\% CI: 0.441-0.901, p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated that the animal food pattern was associated with a higher risk of abdominal obesity, while the traditional Chinese pattern was associated with a lower risk of abdominal obesity.

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify dietary patterns and investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of hypertension among Chinese adults aged 45-60 years. The present cross-sectional study includes 2560 participants who reported their dietary intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using standardized procedures. We used log-binomial regression analysis to examine the associations between dietary patterns and hypertension risk.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Several studies reported a U-shaped association between urinary sodium excretion and cardiovascular disease events and mortality. Whether these associations vary between those individuals with and without hypertension is uncertain. We aimed to explore whether the association between sodium intake and cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality is modified by hypertension status. METHODS In this pooled analysis, we studied 133 118 individuals (63 559 with hypertension and 69 559 without hypertension), median age of 55 years (IQR 45–63), from 49 countries in four large prospective studies and estimated 24-h urinary sodium excretion (as group-level measure of intake). We related this to the composite outcome of death and major cardiovascular disease events over a median of 4·2 years (IQR 3·0–5·0) and blood pressure. FINDINGS Increased sodium intake was associated with greater increases in systolic blood pressure in individuals with hypertension (2·08 mm Hg change per g sodium increase) compared with individuals without hypertension (1·22 mm Hg change per g; pinteraction{\textless}0·0001). In those individuals with hypertension (6835 events), sodium excretion of 7 g/day or more (7060 [11\%] of population with hypertension: hazard ratio [HR] 1·23 [95\% CI 1·11–1·37]; p{\textless}0·0001) and less than 3 g/day (7006 [11\%] of population with hypertension: 1·34 [1·23–1·47]; p{\textless}0·0001) were both associated with increased risk compared with sodium excretion of 4–5 g/day (reference 25\% of the population with hypertension). In those individuals without hypertension (3021 events), compared with 4–5 g/day (18 508 [27\%] of the population without hypertension), higher sodium excretion was not associated with risk of the primary composite outcome (≥7 g/day in 6271 [9\%] of the population without hypertension; HR 0·90 [95\% CI 0·76–1·08]; p=0·2547), whereas an excretion of less than 3 g/day was associated with a significantly increased risk (7547 [11\%] of the population without hypertension; HR 1·26 [95\% CI 1·10–1·45]; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION Compared with moderate sodium intake, high sodium intake is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in hypertensive populations (no association in normotensive population), while the association of low sodium intake with increased risk of cardiovascular events and death is observed in those with or without hypertension. These data suggest that lowering sodium intake is best targeted at populations with hypertension who consume high sodium diets.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The optimal range of sodium intake for cardiovascular health is controversial. METHODS We obtained morning fasting urine samples from 101,945 persons in 17 countries and estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion (used as a surrogate for intake). We examined the association between estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the composite outcome of death and major cardiovascular events. RESULTS The mean estimated sodium and potassium excretion was 4.93 g per day and 2.12 g per day, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the composite outcome occurred in 3317 participants (3.3\%). As compared with an estimated sodium excretion of 4.00 to 5.99 g per day (reference range), a higher estimated sodium excretion (≥ 7.00 g per day) was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.30), as well as increased risks of death and major cardiovascular events considered separately. The association between a high estimated sodium excretion and the composite outcome was strongest among participants with hypertension (P=0.02 for interaction), with an increased risk at an estimated sodium excretion of 6.00 g or more per day. As compared with the reference range, an estimated sodium excretion that was below 3.00 g per day was also associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.44). As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS In this study in which sodium intake was estimated on the basis of measured urinary excretion, an estimated sodium intake between 3 g per day and 6 g per day was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events than was either a higher or lower estimated level of intake. As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events.

	abstract = {Coronary artery disease in patients with hypertension is increasing worldwide and leads to severe cardiovascular complications. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this pathologic condition are not well understood. Experimental and clinical research indicates that immune cells and inflammation play a central role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has been reported that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate heart fibrosis in hypertension. In this study, we determined the role of Tregs in coronary arteriolar endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin II-dependent hypertensive mice. Mice infused with angiotensin II had significantly increased blood pressure, as determined using telemetry, and apoptotic Treg numbers, as measured using flow cytometry. The mice displayed inflammation, assessed by macrophage activation/infiltration into coronary arterioles and the heart, and increased local tumor necrosis factor-α release, which participates in reduced coronary arteriolar endothelial-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine using an arteriograph. Hypertensive mice injected with Tregs isolated from control mice had significantly reduced macrophage activation and infiltration, reduced tumor necrosis factor-α release, and improved coronary arteriolar endothelium-dependent relaxation. Our novel data indicate that Tregs are important in the development of coronary arteriolar endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. These results suggest a new direction in the investigation of vascular disease in hypertension and could lead to a therapeutic strategy that involves immune system modulation using Tregs.

	abstract = {For {\textgreater}50 years, it has been recognized that immunity contributes to hypertension. Recent data have defined an important role of T cells and various T cell-derived cytokines in several models of experimental hypertension. These studies have shown that stimuli like angiotensin II, deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt, and excessive catecholamines lead to formation of effector like T cells that infiltrate the kidney and perivascular regions of both large arteries and arterioles. There is also accumulation of monocyte/macrophages in these regions. Cytokines released from these cells, including interleukin-17, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factorα, and interleukin-6 promote both renal and vascular dysfunction and damage, leading to enhanced sodium retention and increased systemic vascular resistance. The renal effects of these cytokines remain to be fully defined, but include enhanced formation of angiotensinogen, increased sodium reabsorption, and increased renal fibrosis. Recent experiments have defined a link between oxidative stress and immune activation in hypertension. These have shown that hypertension is associated with formation of reactive oxygen species in dendritic cells that lead to formation of gamma ketoaldehydes, or isoketals. These rapidly adduct to protein lysines and are presented by dendritic cells as neoantigens that activate T cells and promote hypertension. Thus, cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system contribute to end-organ damage and dysfunction in hypertension. Therapeutic interventions to reduce activation of these cells may prove beneficial in reducing end-organ damage and preventing consequences of hypertension, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal failure, and stroke.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of autoantibodies against α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AAB) in the serum of patients with primary hypertension, and that these autoantibodies exert adrenergic-agonist-like effects. However, their role in the development of hypertension remains unclear. The current study determined whether α1-AAB can cause vascular contraction, and further investigated the cellular receptors that mediate their vasoactivity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect α1-AAB in blood samples collected from 73 patients with primary hypertension and 86 normotensive patients. IgGs were purified from mixed sera from 25 α1z-AAB-positive hypertensive patients and 20 α1-AAB-negative normotensives, respectively. The vasoconstrictive effect of purified IgG from the sera of either hypertensive or normotensive patients was observed in isolated rat thoracic aorta, coronary artery, renal artery, middle cerebral artery, and mesenteric artery. The effects of α1-AAB administration on mean arterial blood pressure in vivo were also assessed. The frequency of α1-AAB presence was considerably higher in patients with primary hypertension than normotensive subjects (34.2 vs. 10.5\%, P {\textless} 0.01). In isolated thoracic aortic rings, renal artery, middle cerebral artery, and coronary artery segments, α1-AAB induced vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent fashion, which can be completely blocked by prazosin, a selective α1 -adrenoceptor antagonist. The mean arterial pressure significantly increased after the administration of α1-AAB in vivo. Our results demonstrated that the α1-AAB (which exhibited remarkable effects of vascular contraction in vitro, elevated blood pressure in vivo, and showed no desensitization phenomena) may play a role in both elevating vascular resistance and the development and maintenance of hypertension. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

Frequent thyroid function testing and use of Ievothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism suggest that the prevalence may have decreased. Therefore, in this study, we examined changes in the prevalence of hypothyroidism in a Norwegian county from 1995-1997 to 2006-2008. Design: Population surveys of 33 917 individuals in 1995-1997 and 49 180 individuals in 2006-2008 were carried out. Methods: We compared the prevalence of untreated overt, untreated subclinical, and treated hypothyroidism between 1995-1997 and 2006-2008. Results: The prevalence of untreated overt hypothyroidism among women decreased by 84\% from 1995-1997 (0.75\%) to 2006-2008 (0.12\%) (prevalence ratio (PR) 0.16;95\% CI 0.10-0.26). The corresponding decrease among men was 43\% from 0.21 to 0.12\% (PR 0.57;95\% CI 0.28-1.16). The prevalence of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism decreased by 64\% from 3.0 to 1.1\% in women (PR 0.36;95\% CI 0.31-0.42) and decreased by 54\% from 2.1 to 1.0\% in men (PR 0.46;95\% CI 0.38-0.56). Conversely, the prevalence of treated hypothyroidism among women increased by 60\% from 5.0 to 8.0\% (PR 1.60, 95\% CI 1.50-1.71), and the corresponding prevalence in men doubled from 1.0 to 2.0\% (PR 1.96;95\% CI 1.59-2.41). The prevalence of any form of hypothyroidism remained essentially similar at 9\% in women and 3\% in men. Conclusions: The prevalence of untreated hypothyroidism in this Norwegian county decreased strongly from 1995-1997 to 2006-2008. The findings suggest that the prevalence of untreated hypothyroidism in popuIations with easy access to thyroid function testing and Ievothyroxine treatment may now be Iow.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the association between altered thyroid hormones and insulin resistance (IR). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight euthyroid (EU), eight hypothyroid (HO), and eight hyperthyroid (HR) patients with no past medical history were studied in this cross-sectional study at the Care Institute of Medical Sciences, Ahmedabad, India, The fasting blood sample were analyzed for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), lipid profile, insulin, and glucose. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was calculated for assessing IR. RESULTS HOMA values were significantly higher in HR and HO groups as compared to the EU group (P {\textless} 0.05). Insulin levels were also found to be significantly increased in HR and HO groups as compared to the EU group (P {\textless} 0.05). Cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were significantly raised in HO as compared to EU and HR groups (P {\textless} 0.05) whereas high density lipoprotein levels (HDL) were lower. HOMA and insulin were found to be positively correlated with TSH in HO and negatively in HR. CONCLUSION Thyroid disorder, including both hypo- and hyper have been associated with IR due to various mechanisms such as altered insulin secretion and lipid levels. IR was comparable in patients with both HO and HR. Although HO and HR constitute an IR state, more studies need to be done in order to clarify the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Thus, an altered thyroid state can lead to IR leading to glucose-related disorder such as diabetes dyslipidemia.},

It is not clear whether the increased mortality is due to hyperthyroidism itself or the effect of RAI.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the mortality of hyperthyroid patients treated with RAI with that of an age- and gender-matched reference population.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN: We conducted a population-based cohort study.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 2793 patients who received RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism in Tampere University Hospital between 1965 and 2002, and 2793 reference subjects were followed for a median of 9 yr.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Record linkage with Statistics Finland identified all-cause mortality of 453 vs. 406 per 10,000 person-years in the patients and controls [rate ratio (RR) 1.12; 95\% confidence interval 1.03-1.20]. Cerebrovascular diseases accounted for most of the increased mortality among patients (RR 1.40), and mortality from cancer increased (RR 1.29) as well. The risk of death increased in patients older than 60 yr at treatment. Mortality increased with the dose of RAI and was elevated in patients with nodular thyroid disease, but not in those with Graves' disease. Previous treatment with partial thyroidectomy decreased, whereas antithyroid medication did not affect mortality. In Cox regression analysis, RAI-treated hyperthyroidism (RR 1.56) and age (RR 1.10/1 yr) increased, and the development of hypothyroidism (RR 0.52) reduced mortality significantly.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperthyroidism per se probably accounts for the increased cerebrovascular mortality after RAI treatment. Our results of increased cerebrovascular and cancer mortality emphasize the need for long-term vigilance concerning patients treated with RAI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hyperthyroidism affects many organ systems, but the effects are usually considered reversible. The long-term effects of hyperthyroidism on mortality are not known. METHODS We conducted a population-based study of mortality in a cohort of 7209 subjects with hyperthyroidism who were treated with radioactive iodine in Birmingham, United Kingdom, between 1950 and 1989. The vital status of the subjects was determined on March 1, 1996, and causes of death were ascertained for those who had died. The data on the causes of death were compared with data on age-specific mortality in England and Wales. The standardized mortality ratio was used as a measure of relative risk, and the effect of covariates on mortality was assessed by regression analysis. RESULTS During 105,028 person-years of follow-up, 3611 subjects died; the expected number of deaths was 3186 (standardized mortality ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.2; P{\textless}0.001). The risk was increased for deaths due to thyroid disease (106 excess deaths; standardized mortality ratio, 24.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 20.4 to 29.9), cardiovascular disease (240 excess deaths; standardized mortality ratio, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.3), and cerebrovascular disease (159 excess deaths; standardized mortality ratio, 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.5), as well as fracture of the femur (26 excess deaths; standardized mortality ratio, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 3.9). The excess mortality was most evident in the first year after radioiodine therapy and declined thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with hyperthyroidism treated with radioiodine, mortality from all causes and mortality due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and fracture are increased.},

We evaluated the long-term risk of stroke with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism compared with euthyroid status. MATERIAL/METHODS: We used the 20-year follow-up data for adults aged 25 to 74 years who participated in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Follow-up Study. Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism was diagnosed by free thyroxine index measurements at baseline evaluation and incident events were determined from hospital records and death certificates during follow-up. Relative risk (RR) of stroke, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage for each category of thyroid function were determined by Cox proportional hazards analysis after adjustment for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 5,269 participants (mean age 48+/-14 years; 2,379 men) were evaluated. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were diagnosed in 493 (9.4\%) and 34 (0.7\%) participants, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, a significantly higher RR for all strokes and for ischemic stroke was observed in participants with hypothyroidism (RR 1.6; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-2.6 and RR 1.6, 95\% CI, 1.0-2.7, respectively).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute cerebral ischemia has been described in different diseases of the thyroid gland, and not only as a result of thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke. The purpose of this review is to summarize the studies on the relationship between thyroid diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, discussing the main findings for overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as for subclinical thyroid dysfunction. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: In overt hyperthyroidism, cardioembolic stroke is clearly associated to thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, and in subclinical hyperthyroidism with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels {\textless}0.1 mU/L, the incidence of atrial fibrillation is increased. Although in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a hypercoagulability state in hyperthyroidism, there is insufficient evidence to prove that this state leads to an increased risk of cardiac emboli. However, the hypothesis that overt hyperthyroidism may cause acute cerebral venous thrombosis is intriguing. Possible associations between hyperthyroidism and Moyamoya or Giant cell arteritis have only been described in case reports. There is enough evidence that overt hypothyroidism is associated with several traditional and newer atherosclerotic risk factors, especially hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia. For subclinical hypothyroidism, these associations are less certain. Hypothyroidism has been associated with signs of aortic or coronary atherosclerosis, but no case-control or cohort studies have ever investigated hypothyroidism as a possible risk factor for atherothrombotic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthyroidism is associated with atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke. Hypothyroidism is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk factor profile and leads to progression of atherosclerosis. Associations between hyperthyroidism and acute cerebral venous thrombosis, Moyamoya, and Giant cell arteritis have been suggested, but sound evidence is lacking. Additional studies are needed to clarify these issues.},

Although the underlying causes of HF vary according to sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and environment, the majority of cases remain preventable. HF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and confers a substantial burden to the health-care system. HF is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and the elderly. In the USA, the total medical costs for patients with HF are expected to rise from US\$20.9 billion in 2012 to \$53.1 billion by 2030. Improvements in the medical management of risk factors and HF have stabilized the incidence of this disease in many countries.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: The etiology of ischemic stroke affects prognosis, outcome, and management. Trials of therapies for patients with acute stroke should include measurements of responses as influenced by subtype of ischemic stroke. A system for categorization of subtypes of ischemic stroke mainly based on etiology has been developed for the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST). Methods: A classification of subtypes was prepared using clinical features and the results of ancillary diagnostic studies. "Possible" and "probable" diagnoses can be made based on the physician's certainty testedbytwoneurologists who had not participated in the writing of the criteria. The neurologists independently used the TOAST clinicalfeaturesand then after reviewing the results of diagnostic tests. Results: The TOAST classification denotes five subtypes of ischemic stroke: 1) large-artery atheroscle- rosis, 2) cardioembolism, 3) small-vessel occlusion, 4) stroke of other determined etiology, and 5) stroke of undetermined etiology. Using this rating system, interphysician agreement was very high. The two physicians disagreed in only one patient. They were both able to reach a specific etiologic diagnosis in 11 patients, whereas the cause of stroke was not determined in nine. Conclusions: The TOAST stroke subtype classification system is easy to use and has good interobserver agreement. This system should allow investigators to report responses to treatment among important subgroups of patients with ischemic stroke. Clinical trials testing treatments for acute ischemic stroke should include similar methods to diagnose subtypes of stroke. (Stroke 1993;24:35-41)},

METHODS: We evaluated all 1008 consecutive ischemic stroke patients aged 15 to 49 admitted to Helsinki University Central Hospital, 1994 to 2007. Etiology was classified by Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria. Comparisons were done between groups stratified by gender and age. RESULTS: Estimated annual occurrence was 10.8/100,000 (range 8.4 to 13.0), increasing exponentially with aging. Of our 628 male and 380 female (ratio 1.7:1) patients, females were preponderant among those {\textless}30, whereas male dominance rapidly increased around age of 44. The most frequent risk factors were dyslipidemia (60\%), smoking (44\%), and hypertension (39\%). Males and patients {\textgreater}44 clearly had more risk factors. Cardioembolism (20\%) and cervicocerebral artery dissection (15\%) were the most frequent etiologic subgroups. Proportions of large-artery atherosclerosis (8\%) and small-vessel disease (14\%) began to enlarge at age 35, whereas frequency of undetermined etiology (33\%) decreased along aging. Posterior circulation infarcts were more common among patients {\textless}45 years of age. Left hemisphere infarcts were more frequent in general. There were 235 (23\%) patients with multiple and 126 (13\%) with silent infarcts, and 55 (5\%) patients had leukoaraiosis. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of ischemic stroke increases sharply at age 40. Etiology and risk factors start resembling those seen in the elderly in early midlife but causes defined in younger patients still are frequent in those aged 45 to 49. Subclinical infarcts were surprisingly common in the young.},

Cardiovascular diseases, followed by stroke, represent the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both entities share risk factors, pathophisiology and etiologic aspects by means of a main common mechanism, atherosclerosis. However, each entity has its own particularities. Ischemic stroke shows a variety of pathogenic mechanisms not present in ischemic heart disease. An ischemic stroke increases the risk of suffering a coronary heart disease, and viceversa. The aim of this chapter is to review data on epidemiology, pathophisiology and risk factors for both entities, considering the differences and similarities that could be found in between them. We discuss traditional risk factors, obtained from epidemiological data, and also some novel ones, such as hyperhomocisteinemia or sleep apnea.

In view of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the management of ICH, the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) has updated its evidence-based guidelines for the management of ICH.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: A multidisciplinary writing committee of 24 researchers from 11 European countries identified 20 questions relating to ICH management and created recommendations based on the evidence in RCTs using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We found moderate- to high-quality evidence to support strong recommendations for managing patients with acute ICH on an acute stroke unit, avoiding hemostatic therapy for acute ICH not associated with antithrombotic drug use, avoiding graduated compression stockings, using intermittent pneumatic compression in immobile patients, and using blood pressure lowering for secondary prevention. We found moderate-quality evidence to support weak recommendations for intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure to {\textless}140 mmHg within six-hours of ICH onset, early surgery for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score 9-12, and avoidance of corticosteroids.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: These guidelines inform the management of ICH based on evidence for the effects of treatments in RCTs.

Central nervous system infarction is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia, based on neuropathological, neuroimaging, and/or clinical evidence of permanent injury. Central nervous system infarction occurs over a clinical spectrum: Ischemic stroke specifically refers to central nervous system infarction accompanied by overt symptoms, while silent infarction by definition causes no known symptoms.

	abstract = {In 2008, the recently founded European Stroke Organisation published its guidelines for the management of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. This highly cited document was translated in several languages and was updated in 2009. Since then, the European Stroke Organisation has published guidelines for the management of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoidal hemorrhage, for the establishment of stroke units and stroke centers, and recently for the management of intracerebral hemorrhage. In recent years, the methodology for the development of guidelines has evolved significantly. To keep pace with this progress and driven by the strong determination of the European Stroke Organisation to further promote stroke management, education, and research, the European Stroke Organisation decided to delineate a detailed standard operating procedure for its guidelines. There are two important cornerstones in this standard operating procedure: The first is the implementation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for the development of its Guideline Documents. The second one is the decision of the European Stroke Organisation to move from the classical model of a single Guideline Document about a major topic (e.g. management of ischemic stroke) to focused modules (i.e. subdivisions of a major topic). This will enable the European Stroke Organisation to react faster when new developments in a specific stroke field occur and update its recommendations on the related module rather swiftly; with the previous approach of a single large Guideline Document, its entire revision had to be completed before an updated publication, delaying the production of up-to-date guidelines. After discussion within the European Stroke Organisation Guidelines Committee and significant input from European Stroke Organisation members as well as methodologists and analysts, this document presents the official standard operating procedure for the development of the Guideline Documents of the European Stroke Organisation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Overt or subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common within the community, yet the significance of subtle anomalies in thyroid function tests remains contentious. The aims of this study were to: (a) establish reference intervals for serum-free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid antibodies (antithyroperoxidase, TPOAb and antithyroglobulin, TgAb) in the Busselton community of south-western Western Australia; and (b) determine the prevalence of thyroid hormone anomalies in this community. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN In 1981, 2115 adults residing in Busselton participated in a cross-sectional health survey that involved blood collection and a questionnaire on lifestyle and general health history. MEASUREMENTS Serum samples were analysed for FT4, TSH, TPOAb and TgAb by immunochemiluminescent assays. RESULTS Based on standard statistical approaches and using guidelines recommended by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB), reference intervals were derived for each analyte: 9-23 pmol/l for FT4, 0.4-4.0 mIU/l (TSH), {\textless} 35 KIU/l (TPOAb) and {\textless} 55 KIU/l (TgAb). The prevalence of elevated thyroid antibodies was 12.4\% among subjects without a history of thyroid disease and is more common in women than in men. Elevated thyroid antibody levels were observed at both extremes of TSH abnormality, but were more commonly increased when TSH levels were above 4.0 mIU/l (63\% subjects) than for those with TSH levels 0.4-4.0 mIU/l (7.8\% subjects). CONCLUSIONS This study establishes the prevalence of antibodies to thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin in a community-based sample and reference intervals for free T4 and TSH. When the NACB decision limits are applied to older men or women, there is a markedly increased number with 'elevated' autoantibody levels compared to sex- and age-specific reference intervals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present a large European population-based study of thyroid function, performed in a population with longstanding borderline sufficient iodine intake. METHODS: The Nijmegen Biomedical Study is a population-based survey conducted in the eastern part of The Netherlands. Randomly selected inhabitants received a postal questionnaire on lifestyle and medical history, which was filled out by 9371 individuals (41.7\%). We measured serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) in 6434 responders. A reference population of 5167 individuals was selected by excluding those at risk for thyroid disease. RESULTS: Overt thyrotoxicosis was found in 0.4\% of the total population and subclinical thyrotoxicosis in 0.8\%. Overt hypothyroidism was found in 0.4\% and subclinical hypothyroidism in 4.0\%. In individuals older than 60 years, mean FT4 concentrations increased with age. Mean TSH decreased with age, from 1.46 mIU/L at 18-24 years to 1.07 mIU/L after 85 years. The mean TSH in the total population did not differ from the mean TSH in the reference population; the exclusion of those at risk for thyroid disease, however, lowered the upper limit of the TSH reference interval considerably. In the total population, 8.6\% of males and 18.5\% of females had positive TPOAbs. The presence of TPOAbs was associated with abnormally high and low TSH concentrations. CONCLUSION: In inhabitants of the eastern part of The Netherlands, serum TSH gradually decreases with age, whereas after age 60, serum FT4 increases, possibly because of the development of thyroid autonomy after longstanding borderline sufficient iodine intake.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All inhabitants 20 years and older (94009) in Nord-Trondelag were invited to participate in a health survey with a questionnaire and blood samples. RESULTS: The prevalence of former diagnosed hyperthyroidism was 2.5\% in females and 0.6\% in males, hypothyroidism 4.8\% and 0.9\%, and goitre 2.9\% and 0.4\% respectively. In both sexes the prevalence increased with age. In individuals without a history of thyroid disease the median, 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for TSH (mU/l) were 1.80 and 0.49-5.70 for females and 1. 50 and 0.56-4.60 for males.

The prevalence of positive TPOAb ({\textgreater}200U/ml) was 13.9\% in females and 2.8\% in males. In females the lowest percentage (7.9\%) of positive TPOAb was seen with TSH 0.2-1.9mU/l and increased both with lower and higher levels of TSH. The percentage of males with positive TPOAb was lower than in females in all TSH groups except for those with TSH{\textgreater}10mU/l (85\% TPOAb positive).

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Heart failure (HF) is commonly referred to as an epidemic, posing major clinical and public health challenges. Yet, contemporary data on its magnitude and implications are scarce. OBJECTIVE To evaluate recent trends in HF incidence and outcomes overall and by preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Incidence rates of HF in Olmsted County, Minnesota (population, approximately 144 248), between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, were assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients identified with incident HF (n = 2762) (mean age, 76.4 years; 43.1\% male) were followed up for all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations (through December 2012) and death (through March 2014). RESULTS The age– and sex–adjusted incidence of HF declined substantially from 315.8 per100 000 in 2000 to 219.3 per 100 000 in 2010 (annual percentage change, −4.6), equating to a rate reduction of 37.5\% (95\% CI, −29.6\% to −44.4\%) over the last decade. The incidence declined for both HF types but was greater (interaction P = .08) for HFrEF (−45.1\%; 95\% CI, −33.0\% to −55.0\%) than for HFpEF (−27.9\%; 95\% CI, −12.9\% to −40.3\%). Mortality was high (24.4\% for age 60 years and 54.4\% for age 80 years at 5 years of follow-up), frequently ascribed to noncardiovascular causes (54.3\%), and did not decline over time. The risk of cardiovascular death was lower for HFpEF than for HFrEF (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.93), whereas the risk of noncardiovascular death was similar (1.07; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.29). Hospitalizations were common (mean, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.44 per person-year), particularly among men, and did not differ between HFpEF and HFrEF. Most hospitalizations (63.0\%) were due to noncardiovascular causes. Hospitalization rates for cardiovascular causes did not change over time, whereas those for noncardiovascular causes increased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Over the last decade, the incidence of HF declined substantially, particularly for HFrEF, contrasting with no apparent change in mortality. Noncardiovascular conditions have an increasing role in hospitalizations and remain the most frequent cause of death. These results underscore the need to augment disease-centric management approaches with holistic strategies to reduce the population burden of HF.},

	abstract = {Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with coronary heart disease, but the risk of stroke is unclear. Our aim is to combine the evidence on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and the risk of stroke in prospective cohort studies. We searched Medline (OvidSP), Embase, Web-of-Science, Pubmed Publisher, Cochrane and Google Scholar from inception to November 2013 using a cohort filter, but without language restriction or other limitations. Reference lists of articles were searched. Two independent reviewers screened articles according to pre-specified criteria and selected prospective cohort studies with baseline thyroid function measurements and assessment of stroke outcomes. Data were derived using a standardized data extraction form. Quality was assessed according to previously defined quality indicators by two independent reviewers. We pooled the outcomes using a random-effects model. Of 2,274 articles screened, six cohort studies, including 11,309 participants with 665 stroke events, met the criteria. Four of six studies provided information on subclinical hyperthyroidism including a total of 6,029 participants and five on subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 10,118). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) was 1.08 (95 \% CI 0.87-1.34) for subclinical hypothyroidism (I (2) of 0 \%) and 1.17 (95 \% CI 0.54-2.56) for subclinical hyperthyroidism (I (2) of 67 \%) compared to euthyroidism. Subgroup analyses yielded similar results. Our systematic review provides no evidence supporting an increased risk for stroke associated with subclinical thyroid dysfunction. However, the available literature is insufficient and larger datasets are needed to perform extended analyses. Also, there were insufficient events to exclude clinically significant risk from subclinical hyperthyroidism, and more data are required for subgroup analyses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND To determine the cardiological substrate in acute stroke patients presenting with a cardioembolic stroke subtype. METHODS Data of 402 consecutive patients with cardioembolic stroke (cerebral infarction, n=347; transient ischaemic attack, n=55) were collected from a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in which data on 2000 stroke patients over a 10-year period were included. In all patients, specific cardiac disorders were identified by physical examination and results of electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography. Holter monitoring and more sensitive techniques of cardiac imaging were used in selected cases. RESULTS Cardioembolic cerebral ischaemia accounted for 20\% of all acute strokes (25\% of ischaemic cerebrovascular events). Cardiac sources of embolism included the following: (a) structural cardiac disorders associated with arrhythmia (n=232), the most frequent being left ventricular hypertrophic hypertensive disease (n=120) and rheumatic mitral valve disease (n=49); (b) structural cardiac disease with sustained sinus rhythm (n=81), the most frequent being systolic left ventricular dysfunction of both ischaemic (n=35) or non-ischaemic (n=24) aetiology; and (c) isolated atrial dysrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, n=88 and atrial flutter, n=1). CONCLUSIONS Hypertrophic hypertensive cardiac disease complicated with atrial fibrillation was the most frequent cardiac source of emboli in cardioembolic stroke. Other important cardiac sources were isolated atrial fibrillation, rheumatic mitral valve disease, and systolic left ventricular dysfunction of ischaemic and non-ischaemic cause. The incidence of traditional emboligenous-prone cardiac disorders, such as mitral valve prolapse and mitral annular calcification was low.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stroke occurring with atrial fibrillation (AF) is more likely to be fatal or more severe than non-AF stroke based on clinical series, but data from prospective epidemiological studies are sparse and inconsistent. METHODS Over 40-year follow-up of the original 5070 Framingham cohort, 501 initial ischemic strokes, including 103 with AF, were analyzed. Stroke severity was rated as none, mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. Since 1981, functional status indicated by the Barthel index has been evaluated acutely and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Severity and functional status of AF strokes were compared with non-AF strokes using chi 2 test and Student's t test. Thirty-day mortality was assessed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS AF was associated with increased stroke severity (P = .048). Thirty-day mortality was greater in AF strokes than in non-AF strokes (25\% versus 14\%). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 30-day mortality for AF subjects was 1.84 (95\% confidence interval, 1.04 to 3.27). Since 1981, follow-up was available for 150 initial ischemic strokes, including 30 with AF. Compared with the non-AF group, the AF group had poorer survival and more recurrences during 1 year of follow-up. The AF subjects had lower mean Barthel index scores acutely (29.6 versus 58.6, P {\textless} .001) and at 3 months (P = .005), 6 months (P = .003), and 12 months (P = .130) after stroke among survivors. CONCLUSIONS Ischemic stroke associated with AF was nearly twice as likely to be fatal as non-AF stroke. Recurrence was more frequent, and functional deficits were more likely to be severe among survivors. Since stroke is usually the initial manifestation of embolism in AF, prevention is critical to reducing disability and mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND and PURPOSE: In Germany, basic data on stroke morbidity are lacking. If a population-based register in former East Germany is excluded, only routine mortality statistics have thus far provided information on epidemiology of stroke. Therefore, a population-based register of stroke was set up in Southern Germany to determine incidence and case fatality in a defined German population. Methods: The Erlangen Stroke Project (ESPro) is a prospective community-based study among the 101 450 residents of the city of Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany. Standard definitions and overlapping case-finding methods were used to identify all cases of first-ever stroke in all age-groups, occurring in the 2 years of registration (April 1, 1994, to March 31, 1996). All identified cases of first-ever strokes were followed up at 3 and 12 months from onset. RESULTS: During 2 years of registration, 354 first-ever-in-a-lifetime strokes (FELS) were registered. The diagnosis and stroke type were confirmed by CT scan in 95\% of cases. Fifty-one percent of all FELS occurred in the age group {\textgreater}/=75 years of age. The crude annual incidence rate was 1.74 per 1000 (1.47 for men and 2.01 for women). After age-adjustment to the European population, the incidence rate was 1.34 per 1000 (1.48 for men and 1. 25 for women). The annual crude incidence rate of cerebral infarction was 1.37/1000, intracerebral hemorrhage 0.24/1000, subarachnoid hemorrhage 0.06/1000, and unspecified stroke 0.08/1000. Overall case fatality at 28 days was 19.4\%, at 3 months it was 28.5\%, and at 1 year 37.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: The first prospective community-based stroke register including all age groups in Germany revealed incidence rates of stroke similar to those reported from other population-based studies in western industrialized countries, but lower than that observed in former East Germany.},

	abstract = {Background: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study 2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Methods: Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian metaregression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. Findings: All risks combined account for 57·2\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 55·8-58·5) of deaths and 41·6\% (40·1-43·0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87·9\% (86·5-89·3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0\% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5\% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11·3 million deaths and 241·4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10·4 million deaths and 208·1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1·7 million deaths and 176·9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6·1 million deaths and 143·5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5·5 million deaths and 141·5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4·4 million deaths and 134·0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Interpretation: Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.},

	abstract = {Background Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. We sought to quantify the importance of potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke in different regions of the world, and in key populations and primary pathological subtypes of stroke. Methods We completed a standardised international case-control study in 32 countries in Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptom onset and 72 h of hospital admission). Controls were hospital-based or community-based individuals with no history of stroke, and were matched with cases, recruited in a 1:1 ratio, for age and sex. All participants completed a clinical assessment and were requested to provide blood and urine samples. Odds ratios (OR) and their population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, with 99\% confidence intervals. Findings Between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015, 26???919 participants were recruited from 32 countries (13???447 cases [10???388 with ischaemic stroke and 3059 intracerebral haemorrhage] and 13???472 controls). Previous history of hypertension or blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher (OR 2??98, 99\% CI 2??72???3??28; PAR 47??9\%, 99\% CI 45??1???50??6), regular physical activity (0??60, 0??52???0??70; 35??8\%, 27??7???44??7), apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (1??84, 1??65???2??06 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26??8\%, 22??2???31??9 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), diet (0??60, 0??53???0??67 for highest vs lowest tertile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index [mAHEI]; 23??2\%, 18??2???28??9 for lowest two tertiles vs highest tertile of mAHEI), waist-to-hip ratio (1??44, 1??27???1??64 for highest vs lowest tertile; 18??6\%, 13??3???25??3 for top two tertiles vs lowest), psychosocial factors (2??20, 1??78???2??72; 17??4\%, 13??1???22??6), current smoking (1??67, 1??49???1??87; 12??4\%, 10??2???14??9), cardiac causes (3??17, 2??68???3??75; 9??1\%, 8??0???10??2), alcohol consumption (2??09, 1??64???2??67 for high or heavy episodic intake vs never or former drinker; 5??8\%, 3??4???9??7 for current alcohol drinker vs never or former drinker), and diabetes mellitus (1??16, 1??05???1??30; 3??9\%, 1??9???7??6) were associated with all stroke. Collectively, these risk factors accounted for 90??7\% of the PAR for all stroke worldwide (91??5\% for ischaemic stroke, 87??1\% for intracerebral haemorrhage), and were consistent across regions (ranging from 82??7\% in Africa to 97??4\% in southeast Asia), sex (90??6\% in men and in women), and age groups (92??2\% in patients aged ???55 years, 90??0\% in patients aged {\textgreater}55 years). We observed regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, which were related to variations in the magnitude of ORs (rather than direction, which we observed for diet) and differences in prevalence of risk factors among regions. Hypertension was more associated with intracerebral haemorrhage than with ischaemic stroke, whereas current smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins, and cardiac causes were more associated with ischaemic stroke (p{\textless}0??0001). Interpretation Ten potentially modifiable risk factors are collectively associated with about 90\% of the PAR of stroke in each major region of the world, among ethnic groups, in men and women, and in all ages. However, we found important regional variations in the relative importance of most individual risk factors for stroke, which could contribute to worldwide variations in frequency and case-mix of stroke. Our findings support developing both global and region-specific programmes to prevent stroke.

	abstract = {Background The contribution of various risk factors to the burden of stroke worldwide is unknown, particularly in countries of low and middle income. We aimed to establish the association of known and emerging risk factors with stroke and its primary subtypes, assess the contribution of these risk factors to the burden of stroke, and explore the differences between risk factors for stroke and myocardial infarction. Methods We undertook a standardised case-control study in 22 countries worldwide between March 1, 2007, and April 23, 2010. Cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptoms onset and 72 h of hospital admission). Controls had no history of stroke, and were matched with cases for age and sex. All participants completed a structured questionnaire and a physical examination, and most provided blood and urine samples. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and population-attributable risks (PARs) for the association of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke with selected risk factors. Findings In the first 3000 cases (n=2337, 78\%, with ischaemic stroke; n=663, 22\%, with intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke) and 3000 controls, significant risk factors for all stroke were: history of hypertension (OR 2·64, 99\% CI 2·26-3·08; PAR 34·6\%, 99\% CI 30·4-39·1); current smoking (2·09, 1·75-2·51; 18·9\%, 15·3-23·1); waist-to-hip ratio (1·65, 1·36-1·99 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26·5\%, 18·8-36·0); diet risk score (1·35, 1·11-1·64 for highest vs lowest tertile; 18·8\%, 11·2-29·7); regular physical activity (0·69, 0·53-0·90; 28·5\%, 14·5-48·5); diabetes mellitus (1·36, 1·10-1·68; 5·0\%, 2·6-9·5); alcohol intake (1·51, 1·18-1·92 for more than 30 drinks per month or binge drinking; 3·8\%, 0·9-14·4); psychosocial stress (1·30, 1·06- 1·60; 4·6\%, 2·1-9·6) and depression (1·35, 1·10-1·66; 5·2\%, 2·7-9·8); cardiac causes (2·38, 1·77-3·20; 6·7\%, 4·8-9·1); and ratio of apolipoproteins B to A1 (1·89, 1·49-2·40 for highest vs lowest tertile; 24·9\%, 15·7-37·1). Collectively, these risk factors accounted for 88·1\% (99\% CI 82·3-92·2) of the PAR for all stroke. When an alternate definition of hypertension was used (history of hypertension or blood pressure {\textgreater}160/90 mm Hg), the combined PAR was 90·3\% (85·3-93·7) for all stroke. These risk factors were all significant for ischaemic stroke, whereas hypertension, smoking, waist-to-hip ratio, diet, and alcohol intake were significant risk factors for intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke. Interpretation Our findings suggest that ten risk factors are associated with 90\% of the risk of stroke. Targeted interventions that reduce blood pressure and smoking, and promote physical activity and a healthy diet, could substantially reduce the burden of stroke.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has been associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in recent studies, but this relationship is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess whether carotid IMT in patients with SCH differs from that in euthyroid subjects.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Prior to November 2011, we searched PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and the bibliographies of key articles to identify studies that reported carotid IMT in patients with SCH compared with euthyroid subjects. Two reviewers independently evaluated each potential study for eligibility, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We identified 8 observational studies with 3602 patients that met the eligibility criteria. In patients with SCH, the pooled estimate of the weighted mean difference (WMD) of increased carotid IMT was 0.056 mm (95\% CI 0.020, 0.092; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analysis using a pooled sample of the 7 higher-quality studies demonstrated higher carotid IMT level in patients with SCH compared with those with euthyroidism (WMD, 0.064 mm, 95\% CI 0.024, 0.105; P = 0.002). In a subgroup analysis, SCH was also associated with a significant increase in carotid IMT among patients with a mean TSH {\textgreater} 10.0 mIU/l (WMD, 0.082 mm, 95\% CI 0.049, 0.116; P = 0.00). SCH was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride (TG) levels, total cholesterol (TC) levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and with a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that SCH is associated with an increased carotid IMT, which may due to elevated thyrotropin (TSH), dyslipidemia and hypertension. Increased IMT can also be present in patients with serum TSH values less than 10 mIU/l, although there is significant heterogeneity. Prospective studies with larger samples are necessary to evaluate these observations.},

	abstract = {Background Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95\% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1\% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0\% (15·8–18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1\% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1\% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1\%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1\%, 34·7–51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8\%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1\%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the risk of atrial fibrillation in relation to the whole spectrum of thyroid function in a large cohort of patients. DESIGN: Population based cohort study of general practice patients identified by linkage of nationwide registries at the individual level. SETTING: Primary care patients in the city of Copenhagen. SUBJECTS: Registry data for 586,460 adults who had their thyroid function evaluated for the first time by their general practitioner during 2000-10 and who were without previously recorded thyroid disease or atrial fibrillation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Poisson regression models used to estimate risk of atrial fibrillation by thyroid function. RESULTS: Of the 586,460 individuals in the study population (mean (SD) age 50.2 (16.9) years, 39\% men), 562,461 (96.0\%) were euthyroid, 1670 (0.3\%) had overt hypothyroidism, 12,087 (2.0\%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 3966 (0.7\%) had overt hyperthyroidism, and 6276 (1.0\%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. Compared with the euthyroid individuals, the risk of atrial fibrillation increased with decreasing levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from high normal euthyroidism (incidence rate ratio 1.12 (95\% CI 1.03 to 1.21)) to subclinical hyperthyroidism with reduced TSH (1.16 (0.99 to 1.36)) and subclinical hyperthyroidism with supressed TSH (1.41 (1.25 to 1.59)). Both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism were associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: The risk of atrial fibrillation was closely associated with thyroid activity, with a low risk in overt hypothyroidism, high risk in hyperthyroidism, and a TSH level dependent association with risk of atrial fibrillation across the spectrum of subclinical thyroid disease.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important and highly prevalent arrhythmia, which is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality, including a four- to five-fold increased risk for stroke,1,2 a two-fold increased risk for dementia,3,4 a three-fold risk for heart failure,2 a two-fold increased risk for myocardial infarction,5,6 and a 40–90\% increased risk for overall mortality.2,7 The constantly increasing number of AF patients and recognition of increased morbidity, mortality, impaired quality of life, safety issues, and side effects of rhythm control strategies with antiarrhythmic drugs, and high healthcare costs associated with AF have spurred numerous investigations to develop more effective treatments for AF and its complications.8 Although AF treatment has been studied extensively, AF prevention has received relatively little attention, while it has paramount importance in the prevention of morbidity and mortality, and complications associated with arrhythmia and its treatment. Current evidence shows a clear association between the presence of modifiable risk factors and the risk of developing AF. By implementing AF risk reduction strategies aiming at risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which are interrelated, we impact upon the escalating incidence of AF in the population and ultimately decrease the healthcare burden of associated co-morbidities of AF. To address this issue, a Task Force was convened by the European Heart Rhythm Association and the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, with the remit to comprehensively review the published evidence available, to publish a joint consensus document on the prevention of AF, and to provide up-to-date consensus recommendations for use in clinical practice. In this document, our aim is to summarize the current evidence on the association of each modifiable risk factor with AF and the available data on the impact of possible interventions directed at these factors in preventing or reducing the burden of AF. While the evidence on AF prevention is still emerging, the topic is not fully covered in current guidelines and some aspects are still controversial. Therefore, there is a need to provide expert recommendations for professionals participating in the care of atrisk patients and populations, with respect to addressing risk factors and lifestyle modifications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism are both well-known independent risk factors for atrial fibrillation. We aimed to investigate the association of high-normal thyroid function with the development of atrial fibrillation in a prospective population-based study in the elderly. METHODS The association between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and atrial fibrillation was examined in 1426 subjects with TSH levels in the normal range (0.4-4.0 mU/L) and without atrial fibrillation at baseline. In 1177 of the 1426 persons in this group, we also examined the association between free thyroxine levels within the normal range (0.86-1.94 ng/dL [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 12.871]) and atrial fibrillation. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 105 new cases of atrial fibrillation were identified. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for age, sex, current smoking, former smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, history of myocardial infarction, presence of heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol level, and time of the drawing of blood samples. RESULTS The risk of atrial fibrillation was associated with the TSH level. The multivariate adjusted HR was 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.13-3.34, lowest vs highest quartile; P for trend, .02). The multivariate adjusted level of free thyroxine showed a graded association with risk of atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 0.84-3.14, highest vs lowest quartile; P for trend, .06). CONCLUSION Within the normal range of thyroid parameters, persons with high-normal thyroid function are at an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN We explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of thyroid function within the normal range with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and adiposity measures. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS A total of 3483 (50·4\% women) participants for the cross-sectional CVD study and 1630 (41·2\% women) participants for the cross-sectional body composition substudy were drawn from the Framingham Third Generation Exam 1; 2912 participants (50·1\% women) for the longitudinal CVD study and 713 participants (35·9\% women) for the longitudinal body composition substudy were drawn from the Framingham Third Generation Exams 1-2. Thyroid function was assessed by thyrotropin [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] and free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations within the reference range at Exam 1. The associations between thyroid function and CVD risk factors were modelled via multivariable-adjusted regression models. Multivariable adjustment included age, sex, current smoking, postmenopausal status and BMI. RESULTS Cross-sectionally, higher TSH concentration was associated with increased odds of hypertriglyceridaemia [odds ratio (OR)=1·10], and higher BMI (β = 0·19 kg/m(2) ), total cholesterol (β = 0·05 mmol/l), triglycerides (β = 0·0006 mmol/l) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volume (β = 38·8 cm(3) ) (all P {\textless} 0·05). Cross-sectionally, fT4 was inversely associated with metabolic and adiposity-related CVD risk factors, including obesity (OR = 1·17), hypertriglyceridaemia (OR = 1·09), BMI (β = 0·42 kg/m(2) ), total cholesterol (β = 0·05 mmol/l), triglycerides (β = 0·0002 mmol/l), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume (β = -20·7 cm(3) ) and attenuation (0·17 HU) and VAT/SAT ratio (β = -0·01) (all P {\textless} 0·05). However, during 6·1 years of follow-up, baseline TSH and fT4 levels were not longitudinally associated with CVD risk factors and adiposity measures. CONCLUSIONS Thyroid function within the normal range is cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally, associated with CVD risk factors and adiposity measures.},

	abstract = {Cardiac myocytes express the two thyroid hormone receptors (T(3)Rs), T(3)Ralpha and T(3)Rbeta. However, which isoform contributes to specific, T(3)-induced alterations of cardiac function remains unclear. Here, we used individual T(3)R isoform knockout (KO) mice to study the effects of T(3)Ralpha and T(3)Rbeta in the heart. Our findings indicate that potassium channel genes that code for K(+) channels involved in action potential repolarization, like KV 4.2 and minK, are T(3)Ralpha targets. Both are markedly regulated by thyroid status. The recently identified cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, HCN2 and HCN4, are targets of T(3)Ralpha and are unchanged in a euthyroid T(3)Rbeta KO. However, these transcripts respond markedly to altered T(3) signaling concomitant with bradycardia in T(3)Ralpha KO and hypothyroid animals, as well as tachycardia in hyperthyroid T(3)Rss KO mice. SERCA2a and myosins are T(3) regulated and were also targets of T(3)Ralpha, and the papillary muscles of alphaKO animals showed a slowed rate of force development. Because of the absence of significant cardiac effects in euthyroid T(3)Rss KO mice, we determined messenger RNA levels for both T(3)Ralpha and T(3)Rss in the heart. We found that T(3)Rss is present at a 1:3 ratio to T(3)Ralpha1. We conclude that the cardiac phenotype regulated by T(3) is predominantly mediated by T(3)Ralpha and that the lack of T(3)Ralpha cannot be compensated by T(3)Rss in the heart.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone regulation of the cardiac pacemaker gene, the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel gene (HCN2), was studied in rats by Northern analysis. Thyroid hormone administration to hypothyroid rats resulted in a doubling of the HCN2/beta-actin mRNA ratio. A smaller, not statistically significant, increase in HCN2 mRNA occurred when euthyroid animals were made hyperthyroid. A single large dose of L-triiodothyronine given to hypothyroid rats caused a 4.7-fold increase in myocardial HCN2 mRNA expression level and only a 2.3-fold increase in the beta-actin mRNA level. Although the rat HCN2 promoter has not been cloned, we identified a consensus thyroid hormone response element in the promoter sequence of the human HCN2 gene. Therefore, the increase in rat HCN2 mRNA is likely due to L-triiodothyronine stimulation of HCN2 gene transcription. The results suggest that the regulation of heart rate by thyroid hormone may be explained, at least in part, by the positive effect of this hormone on HCN2 gene expression.},

In animal models, hyperthyroidism is associated with increased cardiac L-type Ca(2+) current. Therefore, we assessed L-type channel function and expression in right atria from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Single L-type channels were studied in the cell-attached condition. Voltage dependence of gating was similar in patients with and without latent hyperthyroidism. With use of a pulse protocol leading to maximum channel availability, single-channel activity was further analyzed. Average peak current was significantly enhanced in latent hyperthyroidism, mainly because of an increased channel availability (P {\textless} 0.05). Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. In latent hyperthyroidism, expression of Ca(2+) channel alpha(1)-subunits was increased more than threefold (P {\textless} 0.01). In contrast, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and phospholamban levels were not significantly changed. We only observed a trend toward increased sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase expression (P = 0.085). Function and expression of human atrial L-type Ca(2+) channels are increased in latent hyperthyroidism. These endocrine effects on the heart may be clinically relevant.},

	abstract = {Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with harmful cardiac effects, but its treatment remains controversial. This study was designed to assess the cardiac effects of the normalization of serum TSH concentration in patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism. Ten patients (median age, 59 yr; range, 16-72 yr) with normal serum free T(4) and free T(3) concentration and a stable suppression of serum TSH levels were evaluated by Doppler-echocardiography, by standard and 24-h electrocardiography monitoring (Holter), and by the clinical Wayne index. Ten subjects, matched for age and sex, were used as controls. Patients were reevaluated 6 months after achieving stabilized euthyroidism by using methimazole with a median initial dose of 20 mg daily (10-30 mg daily). After reaching euthyroidism, we found a significant decrease in the heart rate (P = 0.008), the total number of beats during 24 h (P = 0.004), and the number of atrial (P = 0.002) and ventricular (P = 0.003) premature beats. Echocardiographical data resulted in a reduction of the left ventricular mass index (P = 0.009), interventricular septum thickness (P = 0.008), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (P = 0.004) at diastole. Furthermore, the early diastolic peak flow velocity deceleration rate was significantly higher (P = 0.02) in the untreated patients compared with controls. The Wayne clinical index was higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.001) and decreased after treatment (P = 0.004). Serum TSH concentration returned to normal values after 2.5 months (range, 1.0-7.0 months) on methimazole therapy (0.05 vs. 1.42 mU/liter; P = 0.002). Serum free T(4) values were normal in patients before treatment but significantly decreased after reaching the euthyroidism (16.9 vs. 11.5 pmol/liter; P = 0.002). In contrast, serum free T(3) concentration did not differ among the groups. In conclusion, our findings support that early antithyroid therapy should be considered in patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, where it is needed to prevent potential progression to a more advanced heart disease.},

Several symptoms and signs in overt hyperthyroidism suggest abnormality of cardiac autonomic function that may account in part for this excess mortality rate, but few studies have examined cardiac autonomic function in untreated and treated hyperthyroidism. We assessed heart rate turbulence (HRT) and time-domain parameters of heart rate variability in a large, unselected cohort of patients with overt hyperthyroidism referred to our thyroid clinic (n = 259) and compared findings with a group of normal subjects with euthyroidism (n = 440). These measures were also evaluated during antithyroid therapy (when serum-free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations returned to normal but thyrotropin remained suppressed (i.e., subclinical hyperthyroidism, n = 110) and when subjects were rendered clinically and biochemically euthyroid (normal serum thyrotropin, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations, n = 219). We found that overall measures of heart rate variability and those specific for cardiac vagal modulation were attenuated in patients with overt hyperthyroidism compared with normal subjects; measurements of overall heart rate variability remained low in those with low levels of serum thyrotropin but returned to normal in patients with biochemical euthyroidism. Measurements of HRT (onset and slope) were also decreased in patients with overt hyperthyroidism, but HRT slope returned to normal values with antithyroid treatment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of subclinical hyperthyroidism (sHT) on the cardiovascular system still needs to be elucidated. The aim of the study was to prospectively assess blood pressure (BP), variability in heart rate, and the prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sHT, both before and after they are restored to the euthyroid state.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: The study group consisted of 44 normotensive patients (37 women, 7 men), aged 22-65 years (mean±SD: 45.9±11.0) with sHT. Enrolled patients were drawn from 1080 patients referred to our department for treatment of hyperthyroidism. Study patients were treated with radioiodine treatment to restore the euthyroid state. Ambulatory BP monitoring and Holter electrocardiography were performed (i) when sHT was diagnosed and (ii) at least 6 months after they became euthyroid.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: sHT in comparison to the euthyroid state was associated with higher (109.3±7.1 vs. 107.1±7.7 mmHg) nocturnal systolic mean BP (p=0.035) and BP load (14.8 vs. 10.2\%, p=0.033), mean diastolic BP (66.4±6.6 vs. 64.8±6.6 mmHg, p=0.047), and mean arterial pressure (80.8±43.1 vs. 79.3±43.6 mmHg, p=0.049). Moreover, significant changes in both the time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) were observed: decrease of the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (rMSSD) (45.68±34.1 vs. 65.09±50.6 ms, p=0.03) and the low frequency power (LF) (5.71±0.99 vs. 6.0±1.01 ms(2), p=0.049) as well as increase of QT interval dispersion (58.25±28.5 vs. 46.90±12.1 ms, p=0.020). This was accompanied by a clinically insignificant increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles (VES) (3.1±7.4 vs. 0.6±1.2 per hour, p=0.048) and increased mean heart rate (78.4±6.8 vs. 76.0±8.0 beats/min, p=0.004). Some of the parameters correlated positively with thyroid hormones: nocturnal diastolic BP with free triiodothyronine (FT(3)) (r=0.397, p=0.008), rMSSD with free thyroxine (FT(4)) (r=0.389, p=0.013), and QT interval dispersion with FT(4) (r=0.450, p=0.004).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that sHT in comparison to euthyroid status may be associated with a statistically significant but probably clinically insignificant increase of QT interval dispersion, prevalence of VES, elevated nocturnal arterial BP, and changes in HRV. These findings broaden our understanding of the cardiovascular effects of sHT.},

	abstract = {To determine the clinical impact of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, specific symptoms and signs of thyroid hormone excess and quality of life were assessed in 23 patients (3 males and 20 females; mean age, 43 +/- 9 yr) and 23 age-, sex-, and lifestyle-matched normal subjects by using the Symptoms Rating Scale and the Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaires. Because the heart is one of the main target organs of the thyroid hormone, cardiac morphology and function were also investigated by means of standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 24-h Holter ECG, and complete Doppler echocardiography. Stable endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism had been diagnosed in all patients at least 6 months before the study (TSH, 0.15 +/- 0.1 mU/L; free T(3), 6.9 +/- 1.1, pmol/L; free T(4), 17.2 +/- 2.3, pmol/L). Fifteen patients were affected by multinodular goiter, and eight patients by autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. The mean Symptoms Rating Scale score (9. 8 +/- 5.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 2.2, P: {\textless} 0.001) and both the mental (36.1 +/- 9.5 vs. 50.0 +/- 8.5, P: {\textless} 0.001) and physical (42.6 +/- 8.0 vs. 55. 6 +/- 4.1, P: {\textless} 0.001) component scores of Short Form 36 Health Survey documented a significant prevalence of specific symptoms and signs of thyroid hormone excess and notable impairment of quality of life in patients. Holter ECG showed a higher prevalence of atrial premature beats in endogenous subclinical hyperthyroid patients than in the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant, although the average heart rate was significantly increased in the patients (P: {\textless} 0.001). An increase of left ventricular mass (162 +/- 24 vs. 132 +/- 22 g, P: {\textless} 0.001) due to the increase of septal (P: = 0.025) and posterior wall (P: = 0.004) thickness was observed in patients. Systolic function was enhanced in patients as shown by the significant increase of both fractional shortening (P: = 0.005) and mean velocity of heart rate-adjusted circumferential fiber shortening (P: = 0.036). The Doppler parameters of diastolic function were significantly impaired in the patients as documented by the reduced early to late ratio of the transmitral flow velocities (P: {\textless} 0.001) and the prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (P: = 0.006). These data indicate that endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has a relevant clinical impact and that it affects cardiac morphology and function. Moreover, they suggest that treatment of persistent endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism should be considered also in young and middle-aged patients to attenuate specific symptoms and signs of thyroid hormone excess, ameliorate the quality of life, and avoid the consequences to the heart of long exposure to a mild excess of thyroid hormone.},

The studies summarized in the present article have been restricted to those in which explicit measurements of receptor number were made by the use of appropriate radioligands. Particular emphasis is given to an examination of the relationship between thyroid hormone-induced changes in alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor number and accompanying changes in adenylate cyclase activity and more distal adrenergic responses. Although in many instances thyroid hormone-induced changes in receptor number are reflected in coordinate changes in adrenergic sensitivity, this is shown to be by no means uniformly the case. In contrasting instances, modifications at other more distal sites in the sequence of events mediating catecholamine hormone action are responsible for biochemical and physiological changes in catecholamine responsiveness induced by thyroid hormone.},

	abstract = {Thomas Peel Dunhill, a name by now almost completely forgotten in his native Australia, was born in 1876 near Kerang in the State of Victoria. Although he qualified as a pharmacist in 1898, Dunhill had already decided to study medicine and graduated in 1903 from the Clinical School of the Melbourne Hospital. He was regarded as an outstanding student. In 1905 Dunhill was invited to join the Senior Medical Staff at St Vincent's Hospital by Mother Berchmans Daly, the then Mother Rectress. In 1906 Dunhill was awarded the MD and in 1907 he performed his first thyroid lobectomy under local anaesthesia for toxic goitre. As early as 1908, Dunhill understood the essentials for successful surgery in thyrotoxicosis--enough thyroid had to be removed to cure the condition. To this end, he advocated a bilateral attack on the thyroid and advocated thyroidectomy in the thyrocardiac patient. He did this before Theodor Kocher, Charles Mayo, William Halsted or George Crile. In 1911 Dunhill visited the USA and England and communicated his results to the thyroid surgeons in both countries (230 cases of exophthalmic goitre operated on with four deaths). The English could not, or would not, believe his results as the mortality of surgery for exophthalmic goitre at St Thomas's Hospital, London in 1910 was 33\%. Dunhill served with distinction in the Great War and his abilities favourably impressed George Gask, who was to become the Professor of Surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Gask eventually invited Dunhill to join his Unit and Dunhill left St Vincent's Hospital in 1920. Between 1920 and Dunhill's retirement at the age of 60 in 1935, he became the outstanding general surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Dunhill and Cecil Joll, were regarded as the leading thyroid surgeons in the UK. Knighted in 1933, Dunhill was appointed surgeon to the Royal Household, serving four British monarchs. In addition to his brilliant surgical career, Dunhill maintained a love for the land. He was an expert fly fisherman. Dunhill retired from surgical practice in 1949 and died at the age of 80 in 1957 at his London home. Many eulogies were delivered, especially by Sir James Paterson Ross and Sir Geoffrey Keynes, his former pupils. Dunhill's exploits as a thyroid surgeon in the development of a safe and effective treatment for thyrotoxicosis and in operating on the thyrocardiac enables this modest, courteous and loyal Australian to be included with Theodor Kocher, Charles Mayo, William Halsted and George Crile in the pantheon of pioneer thyroid surgeons.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure recommend investigating exacerbating conditions such as thyroid dysfunction, but without specifying the impact of different thyroid-stimulation hormone (TSH) levels. Limited prospective data exist on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and heart failure events. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a pooled analysis of individual participant data using all available prospective cohorts with thyroid function tests and subsequent follow-up of heart failure events. Individual data on 25 390 participants with 216 248 person-years of follow-up were supplied from 6 prospective cohorts in the United States and Europe. Euthyroidism was defined as TSH of 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH of 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as TSH {\textless}0.45 mIU/L, the last two with normal free thyroxine levels. Among 25 390 participants, 2068 (8.1\%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 648 (2.6\%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, risks of heart failure events were increased with both higher and lower TSH levels (P for quadratic pattern {\textless}0.01); the hazard ratio was 1.01 (95\% confidence interval, 0.81-1.26) for TSH of 4.5 to 6.9 mIU/L, 1.65 (95\% confidence interval, 0.84-3.23) for TSH of 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, 1.86 (95\% confidence interval, 1.27-2.72) for TSH of 10.0 to 19.9 mIU/L (P for trend {\textless}0.01) and 1.31 (95\% confidence interval, 0.88-1.95) for TSH of 0.10 to 0.44 mIU/L and 1.94 (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-3.72) for TSH {\textless}0.10 mIU/L (P for trend=0.047). Risks remained similar after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.

Analyses are reported for 4 groups defined according to thyroid function test results: subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and overt hypothyroidism.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Individuals with overt thyrotoxicosis (n = 4) were excluded because of small numbers. Eighty-two percent of participants (n = 2639) had normal thyroid function, 15\% (n = 496) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 1.6\% (n = 51) had overt hypothyroidism, and 1.5\% (n = 47) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. After exclusion of those with prevalent atrial fibrillation, individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation compared with those with normal thyroid function (67 events vs 31 events per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29-3.03). No differences were seen between the subclinical hyperthyroidism group and euthyroidism group for incident coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, or all-cause death. Likewise, there were no differences between the subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism groups and the euthyroidism group for cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. Specifically, individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.07 (95\% confidence interval, 0.90-1.28) for incident coronary heart disease.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Our data show an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and development of atrial fibrillation but do not support the hypothesis that unrecognized subclinical hyperthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with other cardiovascular disorders or mortality.},

After having reached an euthyroid state, both patients normalized their QT intervals, were relieved from earlier symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias and exhibited no longer any documented arrhythmia. Before thyroid substitution, both patients had marked signs of delayed ventricular repolarization even by invasive electrophysiological methods.

	abstract = {Hypothyroidism denotes deficient production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and can be primary (abnormality in thyroid gland itself) or secondary/central (as a result of hypothalamic or pituitary disease). The term 'subclinical hypothyroidism' is used to define that grade of primary hypothyroidism in which there is an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Subclinical hypothyroidism may progress to overt hypothyroidism in approximately 2-5\% cases annually. All patients with overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH {\textgreater}10 mIU/L should be treated. There is consensus on the need to treat subclinical hypothyroidism of any magnitude in pregnant women and women who are contemplating pregnancy, to decrease the risk of pregnancy complications and impaired cognitive development of the offspring. However, controversy remains regarding treatment of non-pregnant adult patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum TSH values ≤10 mIU/L. In this subgroup, treatment should be considered in symptomatic patients, patients with infertility, and patients with goitre or positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Limited evidence suggests that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in patients with serum TSH of up to 10 mIU/L should probably be avoided in those aged {\textgreater}85 years. Other pituitary hormones should be evaluated in patients with central hypothyroidism, especially assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, since hypocortisolism, if present, needs to be rectified prior to initiating thyroid hormone replacement. Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy remains the current standard for management of primary, as well as central, hypothyroidism. Treatment can be started with the full calculated dose for most young patients. However, treatment should be initiated at a low dose in elderly patients, patients with coronary artery disease and patients with long-standing severe hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, treatment is monitored with serum TSH, with a target of 0.5-2.0 mIU/L. In patients with central hypothyroidism, treatment is tailored according to free or total T4 levels, which should be maintained in the upper half of the normal range for age. In patients with persistently elevated TSH despite an apparently adequate replacement dose of LT4, poor compliance, malabsorption and the presence of drug interactions should be checked. Over-replacement is common in clinical practice and is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis, and hence should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex condition with several possible contributing factors. The rapid and irregular heartbeat produced by AF increases the risk of blood clot formation inside the heart. These clots may eventually become dislodged, causing embolism, stroke and other disorders. AF occurs in up to 15\% of patients with hyperthyroidism compared to 4\% of people in the general population and is more common in men and in patients with triiodothyronine (T3) toxicosis. The incidence of AF increases with advancing age. Also, subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor associated with a 3-fold increase in development of AF. Thyrotoxicosis exerts marked influences on electrical impulse generation (chronotropic effect) and conduction (dromotropic effect). Several potential mechanisms could be invoked for the effect of thyroid hormones on AF risk, including elevation of left atrial pressure secondary to increased left ventricular mass and impaired ventricular relaxation, ischemia resulting from increased resting heart rate, and increased atrial eopic activity. Reentry has been postulated as one of the main mechanisms leading to AF. AF is more likely if effective refractory periods are short and conduction is slow. Hyperthyroidism is associated with shortening of action potential duration which may also contribute to AF.},

	abstract = {The estimated prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in the general population is 3\% to 8\%. As the average age of the population in the United States and other countries continues to increase, the overall prevalence of SCH may also be expected to increase. Although age-related changes in thyroid function are well described, normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference limits, derived for age-speciﬁc populations, are not routinely used to identify thyroid dysfunction in elderly adults. Therefore, currently accepted values for the upper limit of normal of TSH may be inappropriate for diagnosing SCH in individuals aged 65 and older, resulting in potential overestimation of the prevalence of SCH in this population. This review discusses the current evidence of the effects of SCH on cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric function in older adults. Although the results of some studies are conﬂicting, the overall evidence suggests that the consequences of SCH may be different for elderly adults than for younger populations. Treatment of SCH in older individuals requires special consideration with regard to thyroid hormone replacement therapy and expected clinical outcomes. Although careful identiﬁcation of individuals with persistent SCH who could beneﬁt from levothyroxine treatment is necessary, current evidence suggests that individuals with TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L who test positive for antithyroid antibodies or are symptomatic may beneﬁt from levothyroxine treatment to reduce the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, and improve their quality of life.

This text summarizes the discussions and opinions of a group of investigators with a long-standing interest in this field. We addressed the occurrence of SCD in individuals apparently healthy, in patients with heart disease and mild or severe cardiac dysfunction, and in those with genetically based arrhythmic diseases. Recognizing the need for more accurate registries of the global and regional distribution of SCD in these different categories, we focused on the assessment of risk for SCD in these four groups, looking at the significance of alterations in cardiac function, of signs of electrical instability identified by ECG abnormalities or by autonomic tests, and of the progressive impact of genetic screening. Special attention was given to the identification of areas of research more or less likely to provide useful information, and thereby more or less suitable for the investment of time and of research funds.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although nonthyroidal illness syndrome is considered to be associated with adverse outcome in ICU patients, the performance of thyroid hormone levels in predicting clinical outcome in ICU patients is unimpressive. This study was conducted to assess the prognostic value of the complete thyroid indicators (free triiodothyronine (FT3), total triiodothyronine; free thyroxine, total thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone and reverse triiodothyronine) in unselected ICU patients.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: A total of 480 consecutive patients without known thyroid diseases were screened for eligibility and followed up during their ICU stay. We collected each patient's baseline characteristics, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and thyroid hormone, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Potential predictors were analyzed for possible association with outcomes. We also evaluated the ability of thyroid hormones together with APACHE II score to predict ICU mortality by calculation of net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indices.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Among the thyroid hormone indicators, FT3 had the greatest power to predict ICU mortality, as suggested by the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.762±0.028. The AUC for FT3 level was less than that for APACHE II score (0.829±0.022) but greater than that for NT-proBNP level (0.724±0.030) or CRP level (0.689±0.030). Multiple regression analysis revealed that FT3 level (standardized β=-0.600, P=0.001), APACHE II score (standardized β=0.912, P{\textless}0.001), NT-proBNP level (standardized β=0.459, P=0.017) and CRP level (standardized β=0.367, P=0.030) could independently predict primary outcome. The addition of FT3 level to APACHE II score gave an NRI of 54.29\% (P{\textless}0.001) and an IDI of 36.54\% (P{\textless}0.001). The level of FT3 was significantly correlated with NT-proBNP levels (r=-0.344, P{\textless}0.001) and CRP levels (r=-0.408, P{\textless}0.001).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: In unselected ICU patients, FT3 was the most powerful and only independent predictor of ICU mortality among the complete indicators. The addition of FT3 level to the APACHE II score could significantly improve the ability to predict ICU mortality.},

We investigated the prognostic value of serum fT3 levels and also low-T3 syndrome on overall survival in a large cohort of hemodialysis (HD) patients with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: A total of 669 prevalent HD patients were enrolled in the study. Serum fT3 level was measured by enzyme immune assay in frozen sera samples at the time of enrollment. Overall mortality was assessed during 48 months of follow-up.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Baseline fT3 was 1.47 ± 0.43 (0.01-2.98) pg/ml, and low-T3 syndrome was present in 71.7\% of the cases. During a mean follow-up of 34 ± 16 months, 165 (24.7\%) patients died. fT3 level was a strong predictor for mortality in crude and adjusted Cox models including albumin or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Further adjustment for both albumin and hs-CRP made the impact of fT3 on mortality disappear. The presence of low-T3 syndrome was associated with mortality in only the unadjusted model.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome. However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze whether subclinical thyroid disorders were associated with CV events and mortality. Study Design Prospective multicenter cohort study. Setting \& Participants Thyroid status and clinical outcomes were explored in 1,000 diabetic hemodialysis patients from 178 centers in Germany. Predictor Thyroid status, defined by the following cutoff values: euthyroidism (thyrotropin [TSH], 0.30-4.0 mIU/L; free triiodothyronine [T3], 2.7-7.6 pmol/L; and free thyroxine [T 4], 11.0-24.0 pmol/L), subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH {\textless} 0.3 mIU/L and free T3/free T4 within reference ranges), subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH, 4.1-15.0 mIU/L and free T3/free T4 within reference ranges), euthyroid sick syndrome (free T 3 {\textless} 2.7 pmol/L and TSH/free T4 low or within reference ranges). Outcomes During 4 years' follow-up, prespecified adjudicated end points were determined: sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, combined CV events, and overall mortality. Short-term effects within the first 12 months were contrasted to long-term effects (years 2-4). Measurements TSH, free T 3, and free T4 levels at baseline. Results Euthyroidism was present in 78.1\% of patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism, in 13.7\%; and subclinical hypothyroidism, in 1.6\%. Euthyroid sick syndrome was exhibited by 5.4\% of patients. The adjusted short-term risk of sudden cardiac death was more than doubled (HR, 2.03; 95\% CI, 0.94-4.36) in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and similarly for patients with euthyroid sick syndrome (HR, 2.74; 95\% CI, 0.94-7.98) compared with patients with euthyroidism. Short-term mortality was increased almost 3-fold for patients with euthyroid sick syndrome (HR, 2.97; 95\% CI, 1.66-5.29), but this effect was not seen in the long term. Subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated with CV events or all-cause mortality. Risks of stroke and myocardial infarction were not affected meaningfully by thyroid disorders. Limitations Observational study design. Conclusions Sudden cardiac death may be influenced by subclinical hyperthyroidism and euthyroid sick syndrome in the short term. Furthermore, euthyroid sick syndrome is associated strongly with mortality in hemodialysis patients. Regular assessment of thyroid status may help estimate the cardiac risk of dialysis patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypothyroidism is a reversible cause of atrioventricular (AV) block. Few reports have described reversible AV block caused by hyperthyroidism. However, it is unknown whether patients with AV block are expected to have a benign course after the initiation of appropriate therapy for thyroid dysfunction. Methods: The study group consisted of patients with II or III degree AV block and bradyarrhythmia (???40. bpm) excluding patients with myocardial infarction, electrolyte abnormalities, digitalis toxicity, and vasovagal syncope. Thyroid dysfunction is diagnosed when thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels are not in defined normal ranges. AV block was determined by surface electrocardiogram (ECG). The cause and effect relation between AV block and thyroid dysfunction was evaluated. Results: Of 668 patients, 29 (4.3\%) had hypothyroidism (19 overt) and 21 (3.1\%) had hyperthyroidism (8 overt). The most frequent ECG finding was complete AV block (27 of 50 patients). Ten patients had bradyarrhythmia and 13 had second-degree AV block. Euthyroid state was achieved in 10 hypothyroidic (34\%) and in 7 hyperthyroidic patients (33\%) with hormone replacement and antithyroid therapy, respectively, during the follow-up period (???21 days). Thyroid dysfunction was found to be not related with AV block in 40 patients (80\%). However, in 4 of 10 patients with AV block related to thyroid dysfunction the resolution of AV block occurred after the placement of pacemaker ({\textgreater}21 days). Overall, 44 of 50 (88\%) patients with AV block in association with thyroid dysfunction were implanted with a permanent pacemaker. Of 6 patients who did not receive a pacemaker, 2 had complete AV block and 4 had bradyarrythmia. Conclusion: AV block associated with thyroid dysfunction needs great attention regardless of type of the thyroid disease. Patients with II and/or III degree AV block in the setting of thyroid dysfunction almost always need permanent pacemaker insertion even after normalization of thyroid status. ?? 2012 Japanese College of Cardiology.},

	abstract = {Heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the Western world. Current therapies aim at treating the symptoms rather than the subcellular mechanisms, underlying the etiology and pathological remodeling in heart failure. A universal characteristic, contributing to the decreased contractile performance in human and experimental failing hearts, is impaired calcium sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). SR calcium uptake is mediated by a Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. However, the initial simple view of a PLN/SERCA regulatory complex has been modified by our recent identification of SUMO, S100 and the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein as regulators of SERCA activity. In addition, PLN activity is regulated by 2 phosphoproteins, the inhibitor-1 of protein phosphatase 1 and the small heat shock protein 20, which affect the overall SERCA-mediated Ca-transport. This review will highlight the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac contractility by the multimeric SERCA/PLN-ensemble and the potential for new therapeutic avenues targeting this complex by using small molecules and gene transfer methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Changes in peripheral thyroid hormone concentration and metabolism can occur in euthyroid patients suffering from severe non-thyroidal illnesses. Recently, sick euthyroid syndrome has been reported in patients suffering from advanced heart failure. AIM This study was to evaluate prospectively the presence and pathophysiological implications of sick euthyroid syndrome in moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure patients. METHODS The study population were 199 chronic heart failure patients admitted over a 2-year period to our heart failure unit for assessment of cardiac transplantation. They were closely followed up with clinical and instrumental examinations (including clinical, hormonal, nutritional and cardiac function evaluations). Sick euthyroid syndrome was defined as a serum total triiodothyronine value of less than the lowest normal limit ({\textless} 1.23 nmol.l-1) in the presence of a normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration. RESULTS Sick euthyroid syndrome was found in 36/199 patients (18\%). According to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of severity of heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome patients appear in higher NYHA classes (31\% of classes III and IV, vs 7\% of class I and II). Such patients also weigh less and are more frequently malnourished. Alterations in cardiac index, ventricular filling pressures, functional impairment, and the liver function parameters, were more significant in sick euthyroid syndrome than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome patients. Serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic factor were significantly higher, and insulin significantly lower in the sick euthyroid syndrome group. During follow-up, deaths were significantly more frequent in sick euthyroid syndrome patients (13/27, 48\%) than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome (30/141, 21\%; P {\textless} 0.005). In six sick euthyroid syndrome patients who underwent heart transplantation, mean total triiodothyronine values increased from 0.9 +/- 0.1 before to 1.96 +/- 0.3 nmol.l(-1)post-transplantation (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a large and representative population of patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome shows a prevalence of 18\%. Its occurrence was related to the degree of functional cardiac impairment, but was not an independent negative prognostic factor. Preliminary results indicate that heart transplantation is associated with reversibility of sick euthyroid syndrome.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Overt hypo- and hyperthyroidism are associated with cardiac disease, whereas this relation is more uncertain regarding subclinical thyroid dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the relation between serum TSH level and cardiac function. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological study and a nested case-control study. SETTING: The study was performed at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: A total of 2035 subjects were included in the epidemiological study and 204 subjects in the nested case-control study (serum TSH {\textless} 0.50, 0.50-3.49, and 3.50-10.0 mIU/liter in 20, 118, and 66 subjects, respectively, all with normal serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Left ventricular mass by body surface area (LVMI) and indices of left ventricular function, as assessed by conventional and pulsed-wave tissue Doppler (PWTD) echocardiography, were recorded. RESULTS: No significant relation was found between serum TSH level and LVMI. In the nested case-control study, the subjects with serum TSH 3.50-10.0 mIU/liter had no signs of cardiac dysfunction. However, the PWTD data showed higher velocities at all measurement sites in the subjects with serum TSH less than 0.50 mIU/liter as compared with the euthyroid group. CONCLUSIONS: With the possible exception of overt hypo- and hyperthyroidism, there is no significant association between serum TSH level and LVMI. Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism, in whom the mean serum TSH level is slightly above the reference range, appear to have normal cardiac function, whereas subjects with serum TSH levels less than 0.5 mIU/liter appear to have changes in myocardial velocities detected by PWTD.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate cardiac function and texture in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) both by conventional and new ultrasonic intramyocardial tissue techniques. sHT was characterized by normal serum free tetraiodotironine and free triiodotironine levels and slightly increased serum TSH level. Twenty-four patients affected by sHT and 24 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. All subjects were submitted to conventional two-dimensional (2D)-color Doppler echocardiography, pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (PWTDI) for the analysis of the diastolic function, color Doppler myocardial imaging (CDMI) for the analysis of regional strain and strain-rate and integrated backscatter (IBS) for the evaluation of intrinsic contractility and tissue characterization. The results of the present study were: (a) the detection in sHT subjects of a lower cyclic variation index (CVI) indicating an altered myocardial intrinsic contractility; (b) a higher ultrasonic myocardial reflectivity indicating an altered myocardial texture; (c) the detection of lower systolic strain and strain-rate indicating an alteration of myocardial regional deformability; (d) an initial impairment of left ventricular diastolic function indicated by a decrease of peak E mitral flow velocity and an increase of peak A mitral flow velocity. All parameters studied with conventional 2D-echo in sHT patients were comparable with controls, except for a mild alteration in diastolic function. A significant correlation among systo-diastolic modifications detected by CDMI and IBS and serum TSH levels were found. The CVI at septum, the PWDTI S-peak wave and the systolic strain at septum were inversely related to the serum TSH levels. In conclusion, the new intramyocardial ultrasonic techniques confirm and extend the previous knowledge on the effect of the sHT on the heart, allowing the detection of early ultrastructural and regional functional systolic and diastolic abnormalities.},

Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2000) 32, 453–464. The mouse has been used extensively for generating transgenic animal models to study cardiovascular disease. Recently, a number of transgenic mouse models have been created to investigate the importance of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport proteins in cardiac pathophysiology. However, the expression and regulation of cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase and other Ca2+ transport proteins have not been studied in detail in the mouse. In this study, we used multiplex RNase mapping analysis to determine SERCA2, phospholamban (PLB), and Na+ /Ca2+ - exchanger (NCX-1) gene expression throughout mouse heart development and in hypo/hyperthyroid animals. Our results demonstrate that the expression of SERCA2 and PLB mRNA increase eight-fold from fetal to adult stages, indicating that SR function increases with heart development. In contrast, the expression of the Na+ / Ca2+ -exchanger gene is two-fold higher in fetal heart compared to adult. Our study also makes the important observation that in hypothyroidic hearts the NCX-1 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated, whereas the SERCA2 mRNA/protein levels were downregulated. In hyperthyroidic hearts, however, an opposite response was identified. These findings are important and point out that the expression of NCX-1 is regulated antithetically to that of SERCA2 during heart development and in response to alterations in thyroid hormone levels},

The aim was to assess whether SCH independently impacts development of LVH over time.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Of 3300 participants of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania those with overt hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, possible thyroid disease or missing echocardiographic baseline data or follow-up were excluded, resulting in a study population of 1112 individuals (556 women) aged 45-81 years. Echocardiographic left ventricular mass divided by height(2·7) (LVMI(ht)), and LVH(ht) (LVMI(ht) {\textgreater} 44 g/m(2·7) in women and {\textgreater} 48 g/m(2·7) in men) was measured at baseline and after 5-year follow-up (median 5·00; range 4·92; 5·08).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to determine whether subclinical thyroid dysfunction was associated with incident heart failure (HF) and echocardiogram abnormalities. BACKGROUND Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been associated with cardiac dysfunction. However, long-term data on the risk of HF are limited. METHODS We studied 3,044 adults{\textgreater}or=65 years of age who initially were free of HF in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We compared adjudicated HF events over a mean 12-year follow-up and changes in cardiac function over the course of 5 years among euthyroid participants, those with subclinical hypothyroidism (subdivided by thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels: 4.5 to 9.9, {\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l), and those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. RESULTS Over the course of 12 years, 736 participants developed HF events. Participants with TSH{\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l had a greater incidence of HF compared with euthyroid participants (41.7 vs. 22.9 per 1,000 person years, p=0.01; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.88; 95\% confidence interval: 1.05 to 3.34). Baseline peak E velocity, which is an echocardiographic measurement of diastolic function associated with incident HF in the CHS cohort, was greater in those patients with TSH{\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l compared with euthyroid participants (0.80 m/s vs. 0.72 m/s, p=0.002). Over the course of 5 years, left ventricular mass increased among those with TSH{\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l, but other echocardiographic measurements were unchanged. Those patients with TSH 4.5 to 9.9 mU/l or with subclinical hyperthyroidism had no increase in risk of HF. CONCLUSIONS Compared with euthyroid older adults, those adults with TSH{\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l have a moderately increased risk of HF and alterations in cardiac function but not older adults with TSH{\textless}10.0 mU/l. Clinical trials should assess whether the risk of HF might be ameliorated by thyroxine replacement in individuals with TSH{\textgreater}or=10.0 mU/l.},

	abstract = {The association of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) with cardiovascular mortality is controversial. This may reflect the different causes of endogenous SHyper in the population studied due to differences in iodine intake, and different selection criteria, e.g. sex, age, and race, the cutoff for serum TSH level, the duration of follow-up, and the presence of co-morbidities. A small sample size of SHyper patients could have caused a low statistical power in some of these studies. In other studies, the results were not adjusted for relevant confounders. Importantly, various meta-analyses have also given conflicting results. This issue of the European Journal of Endocrinology contains two articles that address the association between endogenous SHyper and cardiovascular and total mortality: one study was conducted in a north-eastern German population and the other in a Japanese-Brazilian population. After adjusting for relevant confounders, there was no association between decreased serum TSH levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the Pomerania study; on the contrary, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were significantly higher for individuals with SHyper in the Japanese-Brazilian population. Interestingly, both studies had similar characteristics in terms of selection criteria and duration of follow-up. It remains controversial whether or not to treat middle-aged patients with low serum TSH levels. Large prospective randomized controlled double-blind studies of young and middle-aged patients with SHyper and without underlying cardiac disease are required to assess the potential benefits of treating endogenous SHyper in these age groups.},

Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is a reliable non-invasive means of assessing left-ventricular (LV) diastolic function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate LV diastolic function in patients with primary hypothyroidism receiving thyroxine therapy. METHODS Twelve patients (all females, mean age 47 +/- 17, range 16-69 years) with primary hypothyroidism were studied by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The first examination was made before the start of thyroxine substitution and the second at 37-68 (mean 53 +/- 10) days after commencing thyroxine treatment (mean dose 136 +/- 22 microg/day). RESULTS During thyroxine substitution therapy, the hypothyroid patients became clinically euthyroid and serum T4 increased from 51 +/- 21 to 119 +/- 24 nmol/l; TSH decreased from 50.4 +/- 55.3 to 1.2 +/- 1.5 mU/l. During therapy, heart rate increased from 61 +/- 8 to 68 +/- 10 (p = 0.05). The LV posterior wall (7.8 +/- 1.0 mm) and interventricular septum thickness (8.0 +/- 1.4 mm) were significantly greater in hypothyroid patients than in the control subjects (6.4 +/- 1.0 mm, p = 0.007 and 6.8 +/- 1.0 mm, p = 0.04, respectively). There was no significant change in LV dimensions and wall thickness during follow-up. E/A(max) increased significantly during treatment (from 1.679 +/- 0.432 to 1.947 +/- 0.335, p = 0.006). The isovolumic relaxation time shortened significantly (from 88 +/- 23 ms to 75 +/- 24 ms, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS The present study shows that LV diastolic function as assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in hypothyroid patients is enhanced by thyroxine therapy during a rather short follow-up period.},

The aim of this review article was to assess the results of the prospective studies that evaluated the risk of HF in patients with overt and subclinical thyroid disease and discuss the mechanism of this dysfunction. Evidence Acquisition: Reports published with the following search terms were searched:, thyroid, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, deiodinases, clinical symptoms, heart rate, HF, systolic function, diastolic function, systemic vascular resistance, endothelial function, amiodarone and atrial fibrillation. The investigation was restricted to reports published in English. Evidence Synthesis: The outcome of this analysis suggests that patients with untreated overt thyroid dysfunction are at increased risk of HF. Moreover, persistent subclinical thyroid dysfunction is associated with the development of HF in patients with serum TSH {\textless}0.1 or {\textgreater}10 mU/l. Conclusions: The timely recognition and effective treatment of cardiac symptoms in patients with thyroid dysfunction is mandatory because the prognosis of HF may be improved with the appropriate treatment of thyroid dysfunction.

Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and cause-specific events in subjects with overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants: Participants in the study were subjects who underwent thyroid blood tests, without prior thyroid disease, consulting their general practitioner in 2000-2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality, MACEs, and cause-specific events identified in nationwide registries were measured. Results: A total of 47 327 (8.4\%) deaths occurred among 563 700 included subjects [mean age 48.6 (SD ±18.2) y; 39\% males]. All-cause mortality was increased in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism [age adjusted incidence rates of 16 and 15 per 1000 person-years, respectively; incidence rate ratios (IRRs) 1.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.36] and 1.23 (95\% CI 1.16-1.30)] compared with euthyroid (incidence rate of 12 per 1000 person-years). Risk of MACEs was elevated in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism [IRRs 1.16 (95\% CI 1.05-1.27) and 1.09 (95\% CI 1.02-1.16)] driven by heart failure [IRRs 1.14 (95\% CI 0.99-1.32) and 1.20 (95\% CI 1.10-1.31)]. A reduction of all-cause mortality was observed in subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH of 5-10 mIU/L [IRR 0.92 (95\% CI 0.86-0.98)]. Conclusions: Heart failure is the leading cause of an increased cardiovascular mortality in both overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 5-10 mIU/L might be associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.},

	abstract = {The link between low thyroid hormone (TH) function and heart failure is reviewed in the present report. The idea that TH dysfunction may contribute to diseases leading to HF has been discussed for over 60 yr. A growing body of evidence from animal and human studies, particularly in recent years, suggests that TH treatment may improve clinical outcomes. Indeed, if a similar amount of positive information were available for a newly developed heart drug, there is little doubt that large-scale clinical trials would be underway with considerable excitement. THs offer the promise of improving ventricular contraction and relaxation, improving coronary blood flow, and inhibiting atherosclerosis, and new results suggest they may even reduce the incidence of arrhythmias in heart diseases. Are the potential clinical benefits worth the risk of possible overdosing? After so many years, why has this question not been answered? Clearly, the concept has not been disproven. This review explores the body of clinical evidence related to TH dysfunction and heart failure, discuss insights into pathophysiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms provided by animal research, and discuss what is needed to resolve this long-standing issue in cardiology and move forward.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Studies examining the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and mortality have yielded conflicting results. Emerging data suggest these associations may depend upon underlying congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or race, but this has not been empirically determined. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism overall with mortality according to pre-existing CHF and race. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH higher than assay upper limit of normal; total T4 within reference) and hypothyroidism overall (TSH higher than assay upper limit of normal; total T4 below lower limit of normal or within reference) with all-cause mortality among Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants stratified by CHF and race using multivariable Cox models. To confirm whether differences between strata were statistically significant, we tested for interaction on the basis of CHF (separately) and race by likelihood ratio testing. RESULTS: There were 14 130 (95.0\%) euthyroid controls and 749 (5.0\%) participants with hypothyroidism, 691 (4.6\%) of whom had subclinical disease. Subclinical hypothyroidism vs euthyroidism was associated with greater mortality in those with CHF but not in those without: adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals [CIs]) = 1.44 (1.01-2.06) and 0.97 (0.85-1.11), respectively (P interaction = .03). Similar findings were observed for hypothyroidism overall. Hypothyroidism overall vs euthyroidism was associated with greater mortality in Black participants (HR = 1.44 [95\% CI = 1.03-2.03]) but not in non-Blacks (HR = 0.95 [95\% CI = 0.83-1.08]) (P interaction = .03). CONCLUSION: Among participants with CHF, subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism overall are associated with greater death risk. Additional studies are needed to confirm findings and explore possible mechanisms for the differential hypothyroidism-mortality association across race.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Some experts suggest that serum thyrotropin levels in the upper part of the current reference range should be considered abnormal, an approach that would reclassify many individuals as having mild hypothyroidism. Health hazards associated with such thyrotropin levels are poorly documented, but conflicting evidence suggests that thyrotropin levels in the upper part of the reference range may be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: To assess the association between differences in thyroid function within the reference range and CHD risk.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual participant data analysis of 14 cohorts with baseline examinations between July 1972 and April 2002 and with median follow-up ranging from 3.3 to 20.0 years. Participants included 55,412 individuals with serum thyrotropin levels of 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L and no previously known thyroid or cardiovascular disease at baseline.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nEXPOSURES: Thyroid function as expressed by serum thyrotropin levels at baseline.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) of CHD mortality and CHD events according to thyrotropin levels after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking status.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Among 55,412 individuals, 1813 people (3.3\%) died of CHD during 643,183 person-years of follow-up. In 10 cohorts with information on both nonfatal and fatal CHD events, 4666 of 48,875 individuals (9.5\%) experienced a first-time CHD event during 533,408 person-years of follow-up. For each 1-mIU/L higher thyrotropin level, the HR was 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.90-1.04) for CHD mortality and 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.97-1.03) for a first-time CHD event. Similarly, in analyses by categories of thyrotropin, the HRs of CHD mortality (0.94 [95\% CI, 0.74-1.20]) and CHD events (0.97 [95\% CI, 0.83-1.13]) were similar among participants with the highest (3.50-4.49 mIU/L) compared with the lowest (0.45-1.49 mIU/L) thyrotropin levels. Subgroup analyses by sex and age group yielded similar results.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Thyrotropin levels within the reference range are not associated with risk of CHD events or CHD mortality. This finding suggests that differences in thyroid function within the population reference range do not influence the risk of CHD. Increased CHD risk does not appear to be a reason for lowering the upper thyrotropin reference limit.},

However, the relationship between hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with established HF is still inconclusive.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association of hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality as well as cardiac death and/or hospitalization in patients with HF. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies of hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with HF published up to the end of January 2015. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risk (RR) statistics. We included 13 articles that reported RR estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) for hypothyroidism with outcomes in patients with HF. For the association of hypothyroidism with all-cause mortality and with cardiac death and/or hospitalization, the pooled RR was 1.44 (95\% CI: 1.29-1.61) and 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.22-1.55), respectively.

The study aimed to assess the short-term effects of synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy in patients with low-T(3) syndrome and ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DC). DESIGN: A total of 20 clinically stable patients with ischemic (n = 12) or nonischemic (n = 8) DC were enrolled. There were 10 patients (average age 72 yr, range 66-77; median, 25-75th percentile) who underwent 3-d synthetic L-T(3) infusion (study group); the other 10 patients (average age 68 yr, range 64-71) underwent placebo infusion (control group). Clinical examination, electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and bio-humoral profile (free thyroid hormones, TSH, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, N-terminal-pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide, and IL-6) were assessed at baseline and after 3-d synthetic L-T(3) (initial dose: 20 microg/m(2) body surface.d) or placebo infusion. RESULTS: After T(3) administration, free T(3) concentrations increased until reaching a plateau at 24-48 h (3.43, 3.20-3.84 vs. 1.74, 1.62-1.93 pg/ml; P = 0.03) without side effects. Heart rate decreased significantly after T(3) infusion (63, 60-66 vs. 69, 60-76 beats per minute; P = 0.008). Plasma noradrenaline (347; 270-740 vs. 717, 413-808 pg/ml; P = 0.009), N-terminal pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide (3000, 438-4005 vs. 3940, 528-5628 pg/ml; P = 0.02), and aldosterone (175, 152-229 vs. 231, 154-324 pg/ml; P = 0.047) significantly decreased after T(3) administration. Neurohormonal profile did not change after placebo infusion in the control group. After synthetic L-T(3) administration, left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (142, 132-161 vs. 133, 114-158 ml/m(2) body surface; P = 0.02) and stroke volume (40, 34-44 vs. 35, 28-39 ml/m(2) body surface; P = 0.01) increased, whereas external and intracardiac workload did not change. CONCLUSIONS: In DC patients, short-term synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy significantly improved neuroendocrine profile and ventricular performance. These data encourage further controlled trials with more patients and longer periods of synthetic L-T(3) administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterized by reduced serum T3 levels and increased activity of the T3 degrading enzyme deiodinase D3. This may result in an intracellular composition of the cardiomyocyte mimicking that of hypothyroidism. Short-term T3-administration to systolic HF patients might be beneficial. QUESTION: Does long-term treatment with T3 have a beneficial effect on cardiac function and neurohormonal activation in chronic systolic HF patients with serum T3 levels below 1.6 nmol/l? DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled intervention study with oral T3 treatment twice daily for 3 months. The T3 dose was uptitrated to a final dose avoiding reduced TSH levels. PRIMARY END-POINT: Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS: Cardiac imaging was performed using multiple gated tomographic radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA-SPECT). Neurohormonal stimulation was evaluated by plasma measurements of natriuretic peptides, aldosterone, renin, noradrenalin and copeptin levels. The patients were monitored for potential cardiac arrhythmias at the start of each treatment period. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed the protocol. Mean LVEF was 43\%, range: 37-52 and serum T3 levels 1.4 nmol/l (0.9-1.6). The T3 dose was 20 mug per day (10-40). TSH levels did not change between groups, whereas serum T3 levels increased in the active arm. Cardiac function as measured by LVEF, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and cardiac output did not change during T3-treatment and neither did the neurohormonal profile. There were no side-effects in terms of cardiac arrhythmias and no change in resting heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that oral T3 treatment might be beneficial to patients with chronic, stable systolic HF with a modest degree of reduced LVEF and low-normal serum T3 concentrations. The study included both functional studies of heart contractility as well as measures of the neurohormonal activation.},

	abstract = {HF is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid retention, which may lead to pulmonary and/or splanchnic congestion and/or peripheral edema. Some patients have exercise intolerance but little evidence of fluid retention, whereas others complain primarily of edema, dyspnea, or fatigue. Because some patients present without signs or symptoms of volume overload, the term “heart failure” is preferred over “congestive heart failure.” There is no single diagnostic test for HF because it is largely a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical examination. The clinical syndrome of HF may result from disorders of the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, heart valves, or great vessels or from certain metabolic abnormalities, but most patients with HF have symptoms due to impaired left ventricular (LV) myocardial function. It should be emphasized that HF is not synonymous with either cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; these latter terms describe possible structural or functional reasons for the development of HF. HF may be associated with a wide spectrum of LV functional abnormalities, which may range from patients with normal LV size and preserved EF to those with severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. In most patients, abnormalities of systolic and diastolic dysfunction coexist, irrespective of EF. EF is considered important in classification of patients with HF because of differing patient demographics, comorbid conditions, prognosis, and response to therapies35 and because most clinical trials selected patients based on EF. EF values are dependent on the imaging technique used, method of analysis, and operator. Because other techniques may indicate abnormalities in systolic function among patients with a preserved EF, it is preferable to use the terms preserved or reduced EF over preserved or reduced systolic function. For the remainder of this guideline, we will consistently refer to HF with preserved EF and HF with reduced EF as HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively},

An initially raised serum TSH, with FT4 within reference range, should be investigated with a repeat measurement of both serum TSH and FT4, along with thyroid peroxidase antibodies, preferably after a 2- to 3-month interval. Even in the absence of symptoms, replacement therapy with L-thyroxine is recommended for younger patients ({\textless}65-70 years) with serum TSH {\textgreater}10 mU/l. In younger SCH patients (serum TSH {\textless}10 mU/l) with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, a trial of L-thyroxine replacement therapy should be considered. For such patients who have been started on L-thyroxine for symptoms attributed to SCH, response to treatment should be reviewed 3 or 4 months after a serum TSH within reference range is reached. If there is no improvement in symptoms, L-thyroxine therapy should generally be stopped. Age-specific local reference ranges for serum TSH should be considered in order to establish a diagnosis of SCH in older people. The oldest old subjects ({\textgreater}80-85 years) with elevated serum TSH ≤10 mU/l should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. If the decision is to treat SCH, then oral L-thyroxine, administered daily, is the treatment of choice. The serum TSH should be re-checked 2 months after starting L-thyroxine therapy, and dosage adjustments made accordingly.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Increased insulin concentration is a surrogate for insulin resistance and early assessment of fasting insulin may help in identifying those who are potentially at high risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine age- and sex-related reference values for serum insulin and insulin resistance/sensitivity indices in Iranian subjects. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum insulin levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in 5786 participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. After application of exclusion criteria, 309 non-obese healthy subjects (124 men and 185 women), aged 24-83 y, were included. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry guidelines (non-parametric method) and the robust method were used for determining reference values. RESULTS: Overall 95\% reference values for fasting insulin were 1.61-11.37, 2.34-11.98, and 2.11-12.49 μU/mL in men, women, and total population respectively. Mean fasting insulin concentration showed a decreasing trend with age in both genders (p for trend ≤0.001). Age, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressures were biological determinants of fasting insulin in both genders; in addition, insulin was modulated by triglycerides in men and fasting glucose in women. Reference intervals for HOMA1-IR, HOMA2-IR, and QUICKI were 0.63-2.68, 0.40-1.80, and 0.33-0.42, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first set of reference values for fasting serum insulin to be 2-12 μU/mL for both genders in a healthy sample of Iranian adults along with the reference values for insulin resistance/sensitivity indices. These values could be used for identifying subjects with insulin resistance in epidemiological and clinical research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with autoimmune overt hypothyroidism may present with goitrous Hashimoto's disease or autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis. Little is known about the prevalence of subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism. The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between thyroid autoantibodies in serum and abnormalities in thyroid function and structure, and to study the thyroid volume in subjects with subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism. DESIGN: A population study including 4649 randomly selected subjects. MEASUREMENTS: Blood tests were used to analyse for thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Ab), thyroglobulin autoantibodies (Tg-Ab), TSH, fT3 and fT4. RESULTS: Thyroid volume was categorized as small ( 14.9 ml) in 34.9\% of participants. Thyroid nodules were found in 29.7\%. Serum TSH was low ( 3.6) in 4.3\%. The prevalence rate of subclinical goitrous Hashimoto's disease was 0.62\% and of subclinical autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis 0.24\%. There was a strong association between large volume and autoantibodies, but only in subjects with elevated TSH (P {\textless} 0.001). An association between thyroid nodules and TPO-Ab in univariate analyses (P {\textless} 0.001) was due to confounding by sex and age (multivariate model, P = 0.23). CONCLUSION: We identified a subgroup of the population with subclinical goitrous Hashimoto's disease and a smaller subgroup with subclinical autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis. This relationship between small and large thyroid volume in subclinical disease is opposite to that in overt disease, which may suggest that the period between development of a small volume with circulating autoantibodies and overt hypothyroidism is relatively short.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between thyroid function and the components of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in an Hispanic population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Subjects with no history of thyroid disease or diabetes were included. Thyroid function was stratified as euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) status and subsequently by free thyroxine (FT(4)) and TSH tertiles. The association of the metabolic syndrome components (defined by 2004 Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and insulin resistance with thyroid status, TSH, and FT(4) were examined. RESULTS: A total of 3148 subjects were analyzed. The prevalence of SCH was 8.3\%. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was similar in euthyroid and SCH patients (31.6 vs 32.06\%, P=0.89). Total cholesterol was higher in patients with SCH (5.51+/-1.19 vs 5.34+/-1.05 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.032). Serum TSH values showed a positive correlation (adjusted for age and sex) with total cholesterol, triglycerides, and waist circumference. In contrast, FT(4) showed a positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and an inverse correlation with waist circumference, insulin, and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION: SCH is not associated with an increased risk for the metabolic syndrome (as conceived as a diagnostic category defined by the National Cholesterol, Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III criteria). Despite this, low thyroid function (even in the euthyroid state) predisposes to higher cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels. The combined use of TSH and FT(4), compared with the assessment based on only FT(4), is a more convenient approach to evaluate the association between thyroid function and metabolic variables.},

	abstract = {Thyroid disease has been associated with the occurrence of pathophysiologic changes in the vasculature that may result in part from altered serum thyroid hormone and serum lipid levels. Thyrotropin (TSH) levels are also altered in thyroid disease, but a direct effect of TSH on vascular smooth muscle has not previously been considered. In the present study, human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) were induced into two morphologically distinct forms by culturing in either (1) growth factor supplemented, 0.5\% serum medium (SmGM-3) or (2) basal medium (SmBM) plus 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was determined by radioimmunoassay after exposure to increasing doses of bovine TSH. Cells grown in SmBM/10\% FBS for 3 days exhibited a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP that reached a level 10 times higher than baseline at the highest dose examined (100 mIU/mL). In contrast, cells grown in SmGM-3 medium exhibited no change in intracellular cAMP on exposure to increasing TSII. Low serum (0.5\% FBS) reduced the ability of TSH to stimulate cAMP above the control value in CASMC. Pretreatment of CASMC with either transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) lowered basal levels of cAMP production, but did not inhibit the ability of TSH to stimulate cAMP production. Human, but not rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture also responded to TSH with a significant increase in cAMP. The results of this study suggest that TSH may exert direct effects on vascular smooth muscle mediated by adenylate cyclase activation that could conceivably affect the progression of vascular disease associated with thyroid dysfunction.},

Two hundred and fifty had at least one thyroid antibody, 121 were taking medications other than estrogens and occasional analgesics, and 105 reported a family history of thyroid disease. Serum TSH, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOab) and thyroglobulin antibodies (Tgab) were determined on AutoDELFIA and TSHRab by a radioreceptor assay (RRA) from Brahms Diagnostica. For individuals without thyroid antibodies and other risk factors, no effect of age and gender was seen for serum TSH. Neither medication nor the presence of Tgab alone had any influence on serum TSH. TPOab alone or in combination with Tgab were associated with an increased serum TSH level. The 'cumulative percentage distributions' of subgroups, as well as the combined population, was In-Gaussian distributed. The central 95\% of the population was within the 95\% CI in rankit-plots. Consequently, a common reference interval for serum TSH of 0.58-4.07 mlU/l for all adults between 17 and 66 years of age was established. This reference interval is much higher than expected from the NACB-guidelines.},

Subjects were participants in the ongoing Healthy Women Study, a prospective study of cardiovascular risk factor change through menopause. Healthy premenopausal women were recruited from a random sample of licensed drivers in selected ZIP codes of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Participants had to be 42-50 years of age, have menstruated within the last 3 months, not have had surgical menopause, have diastolic blood pressure {\textless} 100 mm Hg, and not be taking medications (including insulin, estrogen, lipid-lowering drugs, or thyroid or antihypertensive medications) at the baseline examination. The substudy included three groups of women who were premenopausal at baseline and were categorized according to change noted at follow-up regarding menopausal status and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The groups comprised 95 women who remained premenopausal, 96 postmenopausal women not on HRT, and 61 postmenopausal women using HRT. The main outcome measures were baseline and follow-up measurements for serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase, and thyroglobulin, as well as serum cholesterol, total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and calculated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, height, and weight. Covariates included cigarette smoking and alcohol intake. The prevalence of thyroid antibodies in this healthy population was high at both time points (range 27\%-31\%) and did not differ by menopausal status. The presence of thyroid antibodies was associated with increased TSH concentration. Women with antibodies at both time points had lower levels of total and LDL cholesterol compared with those with no antibodies, significant only for those women who remained premenopausal during the follow-up period. Thyroid function during menopause in this healthy population is unlikely to account for the observed changes in levels of serum lipoprotein and body weight. The presence of thyroid antibodies may be associated with lower total and LDL cholesterol, possibly through an underlying inflammatory disorder.},

	abstract = {The upper limit of the TSH reference range is currently under discussion. In its recent guidelines, the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) recommended the use of approximately 2.5 mIU/L, rather than approximately 4 mIU/L, due to the fact that reference populations, on which the definition of the reference range is based, contain persons undergoing an initial phase of autoimmune thyroid disease. This will skew the upper reference limit of TSH. Ultrasonography, in addition to measurement of thyroid autoantibodies, should be used to exclude these persons. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigates whether the NACB recommendation also applies for a region of mild iodine deficiency. METHODS: According to NACB criteria, a reference population (713 persons) was defined out of a total study population of 1442. The TSH reference range was calculated in this reference group and in further subgroups by percentiles. The results were compared with the total study population and the NACB recommendation. All assays used were provided by BRAHMS Diagnostica AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany. RESULTS: As expected, all median TSH values, excluding the median of the group with a hypoechogenic thyroid were close to 1.2 mIU/L. The 97.5th percentile in the reference population was 3.35 mIU/L. However, there was no difference compared to the total study population. CONCLUSION: The upper reference limit for TSH based on a reference population according to NACB criteria came down to 3.35 mIU/L, but not to approximately 2.5 mIU/L. Interestingly, there is no difference compared to the total study population.},

The use of iodized salt was introduced in the late 1940's but added only 15 micrograms of iodine to the daily intake. In the late 1950's iodine prophylaxis was intensified and the use of salt containing 25 mg KI/kg was recommended. In 1978 about 95\% of all household salt used in the Savonlinna area was iodized. This region in the east of Finland has been used as an area of surveillance and studies have been carried out there in 1959, 1969 and 1979. During this period the thyroidal uptake decreased from 67 to 23\% in non-goitrous subjects and from 62 to 28\% in goitre patients the difference between the two last figures being statistically significant. The goitre patients also had significantly higher serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. During the same period the urinary excretion of stable 127I increased from 45 micrograms to about 250 micrograms a day. Concomitantly the goitre prevalence among school children has decreased.

Mild variations of thyroid function, even within normal limits, can have significant consequences for cognitive function in the elderly. Different cognitive deficits possibly related to thyroid failure do not necessarily follow a consistent pattern, and L-thyroxine treatment may not always completely restore normal functioning in patients with hypothyroidism.

	abstract = {AIMS: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, mainly attributable to dyslipidaemia and hypercoagulability. However, conflicting data exist regarding the effect of L-thyroxine substitution on these parameters. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of L-thyroxine therapy on lipidaemic profile, coagulation markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and glucose homoeostasis in SH patients. METHODS: It was a prospective open-label study. The following parameters were measured before and 6 months after intervention: anthropometric data, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins B (apoB) and A1 (apoA1), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], fasting plasma glucose and insulin, homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hsCRP, antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), fibrinogen and homocysteine. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (30 women) aged 52.1 ± 13.9 years with SH completed the study. Baseline mean TSH levels were 6.79 ± 2.58 mIU/ml. Achievement of euthyroidism significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (BP) in patients with SH (from 135.2 ± 18.5 to 129.7 ± 15.8 mmHg, p = 0.03) and diastolic BP only in those with baseline TSH levels {\textgreater} 7 mIU/ml (from 79.5 ± 9.8 to 72.1 ± 7.3 mmHg, p = 0.03). No significant changes in body weight, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, apoB, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, AT-III, PC, PS, fibrinogen or homocysteine levels were noticed after restoration of euthyroidism, except for a decrease in apoA1 (p = 0.04) and an increase in Lp(a) levels (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Except for a reduction in systolic and diastolic BP, thyroid substitution therapy does not affect lipidaemic profile, systematic inflammation, glucose homoeostasis or coagulation in patients with SH.},

AIM: To analyze how thyroid function is associated with insulin resistance and another cardiovascular risk factors in healthy adolescents with risk factors to develop diabetes. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional analysis was carried out on euthyroid, adolescents. considered at high risk to develop Type 2 diabetes. Fasting blood samples were obtained. Thyroid function test and another cardiometabolic parameters were assessed. A 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test was performed to calculate insulin resistance. RESULTS: One hundred adolescents were evaluated. The mean age was 15.9 ± 0.8 years, There is a negative correlation between Fasting insulin, post glucose load insulin and HOMA IR. There were no correlation with Matsuda index. We could not found any correlation with TSH values. CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between fasting insulin, HOMA IR and serum thyroid hormones, we did not find any relation with serum TSH. In euthyroid adolescents with risk factors to develop diabetes.},

	abstract = {The established function of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is to promote thyroid follicle development and hormone secretion. The osteoporosis associated with hyperthyroidism is traditionally viewed as a secondary consequence of altered thyroid function. We provide evidence for direct effects of TSH on both components of skeletal remodeling, osteoblastic bone formation, and osteoclastic bone resorption, mediated via the TSH receptor (TSHR) found on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors. Even a 50\% reduction in TSHR expression produces profound osteoporosis (bone loss) together with focal osteosclerosis (localized bone formation). TSH inhibits osteoclast formation and survival by attenuating JNK/c-jun and NFkappaB signaling triggered in response to RANK-L and TNFalpha. TSH also inhibits osteoblast differentiation and type 1 collagen expression in a Runx-2- and osterix-independent manner by downregulating Wnt (LRP-5) and VEGF (Flk) signaling. These studies define a role for TSH as a single molecular switch in the independent control of both bone formation and resorption.},

	abstract = {The determination of the reference intervals for serum free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) is usually based on central 95 percentile intervals using subjects without detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) or thyroglobulin (Tg). However, some subjects with extreme data over reference intervals are generally included. The study objective was to evaluate the reference intervals for FT4 and TSH using different outlier tests. 1,007 Japanese subjects screened based on the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry criteria in the United States participated in this study. Serum FT4, TSH, and TPOand Tg antibodies were measured in all subjects. To make appropriate reference intervals, the Smirnov-Grubbus' outlier test was taken for antibody-free subjects (Ab[-] S-G), and the conventional outlier rejection method rejecting the value out of +/-3 standard deviation was taken for antibody-free subjects (Ab[-] STD) and all subjects (ALSTD), respectively. 12.8\% of all subjects had either TPOor Tg antibodies in their serum. The 2.5(th) and 97.5(th) percentiles of reference intervals of serum FT4 (ng/dL) and TSH (mU/L) were 1.03{\textasciitilde}1.66 and 0.51 approximately 5.14 in (Ab[-] S-G), 1.03 approximately 1.65 and 0.51 approximately 4.57 in (Ab[-] STD) and 1.03 approximately 1.66 and 0.51 approximately 4.67 in (ALSTD), respectively. FT4 in males were significantly and negatively correlated with age, and TSH was significantly and positively correlated with age (P{\textless}0.000001 and P{\textless}0.00001, respectively). There was a significant difference between the sexes in FT4 (P{\textless}0.00001) but not in TSH. The prevalence of hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, sublinical hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 0.2, 3.1, 2.3 and 0.3\% (Ab[-] S-G), 0.3, 4.7, 2.3 and 0.3\%(Ab[-] STD), and 0.3, 4.3, 2.3 and 0.3\% (AL STD), respectively. This finding indicates that the conventional outlier rejection method is both convenient and appropriate to provide reference intervals for serum FT4 and TSH levels without regard to thyroid antibodies using large samples.},

OBJECTIVE We assessed the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and cardiovascular (CV) death in older adults with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study included 679 subclinically hypothyroid and 4184 euthyroid U.S. individuals at least 65 yr old enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study and not taking thyroid preparations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE We measured the 10-yr risk of incident CHD, HF, and CV death from persistent subclinical hypothyroidism, overall and stratified by degree of TSH elevation (4.5-6.9, 7.0-9.9, and 10.0-19.9 mU/liter). RESULTS There was no association between persistent subclinical hypothyroidism and incident CHD [hazard ratio (HR), 1.12; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.93-1.36], HF (HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.27), or CV death (HR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.31) in adjusted analyses in which subclinical hypothyroidism was modeled as a time-varying exposure using up to four serial thyroid function tests. When subclinical hypothyroidism was stratified by degree of TSH elevation, no significant associations were found in any stratum. Findings were similar in fixed exposure analyses in which only participants with testing 2 yr apart were considered, with no association between persistent or transient subclinical hypothyroidism and incident CHD, HF, or CV death. CONCLUSIONS Our data do not support increased risk of CHD, HF, or CV death in older adults with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism.},

Stroke volume and heart rate increase over the course of pregnancy with heart rate increasing gradually until term. The heart of the pregnant woman remodels dramatically in the first few weeks of pregnancy; end diastolic volume increases. Stroke volume is augmented by the increase in end diastolic volume and maintenance of ejection fraction through a possible increase in contractile force. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures drop during normal pregnancy. There is evidence of blood vessel remodeling in all vessels. Venous compliance and venous blood volume are increased. Renal plasma flow increases by some 70\% in pregnancy with glomerular filtration rate increasing by 50\% by unknown mechanisms. The complex hormonal environment is changing throughout pregnancy.

STUDY DESIGN: This 6-month prospective observational study included 1435 women in labor who had no hypertensive disorders either before or during pregnancy. SBP and DBP were measured every 15min during labor and signs of preeclampsia were checked for in the early postpartum period. RESULTS: Mean maximum SBP and DBP were significantly higher during the first stage of labor without any treatment compared to the last prenatal visit: 135 vs. 119mmHg and 81 vs. 74mmHg, respectively (p{\textless}0001). Epidural analgesia had no effect on maximum SBP or DBP during labor whereas oxytocin administration moderately increased SBP (137.8 vs. 135.2mmHg; p{\textless}0.05). Early postpartum preeclampsia was identified in 0.9\% of the women. A maximum SBP equal or higher than 150mmHg or DBP equal or higher than 91mmHg during labor were predictive of early postpartum preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 77\% and a specificity of 71\%. CONCLUSION: SBP and DBP values during labor are higher than those observed in the antepartum period. An SBP equal or higher than 150mmHg or DBP equal or higher than 91mmHg are associated with an increased risk of early postpartum preeclampsia.},

These social science concepts can be developed into clinical strategies with direct application in practice and teaching. One such strategy is outlined as an example of a clinical social science capable of translating concepts from cultural anthropology into clinical language for practical application.

	abstract = {In a double-blind, controlled, randomized, four-arm, bicentric clinical study, the effect of four oral contraceptives (OCs) on thyroid hormone parameters, cortisol, aldosterone, endothelin-1 and angiotensin II was investigated. Four groups composed of 25 volunteers each (ages between 18 and 35 years) were treated for six cycles with monophasic combinations containing 21 tablets with either 30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) + 2 mg dienogest (DNG) (30EE/DNG), 20 microg EE + 2 mg DNG (20EE/DNG), 10 microg EE + 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV) + 2 mg DNG (EE/EV/DNG) or 20 microg EE + 100 microg levonorgestrel (LNG) (EE/LNG). The study was completed by 91 subjects. Blood samples were taken by venipuncture after at least 12 h fasting on Day 21-26 of the control cycle and on Day 18-21 of the first, third and sixth treatment cycle. There was a significant increase in triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) by 20-40\% in all treatment cycles, while thyroid-stimulating hormone was significantly increased only with EE/EV/DNG. Treatment with the DNG-containing OCs caused no change in free T4 (FT4) and a transitory reduction in free T3 (FT3) levels during the first cycle. During intake of EE/LNG, FT4 rose slightly, while FT3 was not altered. The pronounced rise in the serum concentrations of cortisol appeared to be related to the EE dose. During the first three cycles of treatment, no effect on angiotensin II levels was observed, while in the sixth cycle a significant decrease was measured in all treatment groups. The four OCs did not influence the serum concentrations of endothelin-1 and no consistent effects were found concerning those of aldosterone. The results suggest that the three DNG-containing and the LNG-containing low-dose OCs may increase T3, T4 and cortisol due to an elevated binding to serum globulins, while the free proportion of the hormones is not or only slightly changed. Therefore, these OCs have only minor effects on thyroid function, adrenal and blood pressure serum parameters.},

	abstract = {On the basis of low specificity, poor positive predictive value, and cost, there is at present no basis for routine assessment of thyroid function in acutely hospitalized patients, unless clinical features suggest the possibility of thyroid dysfunction, or a patient's background increases the likelihood of thyroid dysfunction. When used in severely ill patients, estimates of both thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin (TSH) show a high prevalence of abnormal results, but lack specificity and have poor positive predictive value for true thyroid disease. When thyroid function is tested in the critically ill, the positive predictive value for true thyroid disease of both free T4 and TSH measurements could be improved by using wider reference intervals than for unselected populations. The knowledge of nonspecific disease-related abnormalities of triiodothyronine, T4, and TSH is not currently likely to yield useful prognostic information or to alter management for individual patients. Thyroid testing should be readily available for any acutely ill patient with any clinical features that suggest thyroid dysfunction, and for groups at increased risk of thyroid dysfunction. An initial abnormal result for either TSH or free T4 estimate should be followed by combined analysis of free T4 and TSH with the best available methodology. Diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction should be based on the T4-TSH relation rather than either value alone. Persistence of an apparent diagnostic abnormality should be confirmed before therapy is commenced.},

Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or  ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.},

	abstract = {AIM: The upper reference limit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is critical for defining patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, a condition which carries a higher risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and adverse cardiovascular events. Yet, there is a lack of consensus on its absolute value, and data in non-pregnant adult Chinese are lacking. METHODS: Apparently healthy and drug-free local adult Chinese were recruited by completing health questionnaires. Their serum samples were tested for TSH, free thyroxine (FT4), thyroglobulin antibody and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. After excluding subjects with thyroid antibodies, the TSH level was log-transformed, and the reference limits were defined as mean +/- 1.96SD. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of FT4 were also calculated. RESULTS: Serum samples from 212 subjects were used in this study. 51 subjects were seropositive to thyroglobulin antibody, 31 were seropositive to thyroid peroxidase antibody, and 27 were seropositive to both. The reference intervals after excluding subjects seropositive to thyroid antibodies were: TSH: 0.68-3.70 mIU/l; FT4: 13.5-21.3 pmol/l (male) and 12.6-19.7 pmol/l (female). Including subjects with thyroid antibodies only minimally changed the reference intervals of these hormones. CONCLUSION: The authors have set up the reference interval of TSH for the local population, and their findings also suggest that the importance of excluding subjects with thyroid antibodies in the reference population should not be overemphasised. Moreover, the international authorities should consider recommending percentile-equivalent action limits instead of an absolute cut-off on TSH for categorisation of different types of thyroid dysfunction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence suggests that hypothyroidism could promote atherosclerotic vascular changes. We planned this study to investigate whether serum free thyroxine (FT4) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with coronary artery calcification measured in healthy euthyroid subjects. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed among subjects who visited our hospital for a health checkup. Among 1849 subjects, 669 (mean age 55.3+/-8.8 years; 392 men) with FT4 and TSH in the normal ranges were included after excluding those with diabetes, a history of current smoking and cardiovascular disease (CVD), or the use of drugs for hypertension, antithyroid drugs, or thyroid hormone preparations. Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) were measured by multi-detector computed tomography. RESULTS: Subjects with a CACS {\textgreater}100 had lower FT4 levels than those with a lower CACS (p=0.017), whereas no difference was observed in the TSH levels among CACS categories. FT4 levels had an odds ratio of 0.06 for high CACS (95\% confidence interval=0.01-0.74; p=0.028) after the adjustment for CVD risk factors. In multivariate regression analysis, CACS was negatively correlated with FT4 levels (beta=-0.823, p=0.032), and the inverse association between FT4 and CACS remained significant only in men (p=0.011). CONCLUSION: FT4 levels were inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in euthyroid healthy subjects, especially in men independent of conventional CVD risk factors. Further studies are needed to validate whether subjects with decreased FT4 levels within the normal reference range are at a high CVD risk and have poor cardiovascular outcomes.},

	issn = {1524-4563; 0194-911X},
	abstract = {The linkage and association between inherent blood pressure and underlying genotype is potentially confounded by antihypertensive treatment. We estimated blood pressure variance components (genetic, shared environmental, individual-specific) in 767 adult volunteer families by using a variety of approaches to adjusting blood pressure of the 244 subjects (8.2\%) receiving antihypertensive medications. The additive genetic component of variance for systolic pressure was 73.9 mm Hg(2) (SE, 8.8) when measured pressures (adjusted for age by gender within each generation) were used but fell to 61.4 mm Hg(2) (SE, 8.0) when treated subjects were excluded. When the relevant 95th percentile values were substituted for treated systolic pressures, the additive genetic component was 81.9 mm Hg(2) (SE, 9.5), but individual adjustments in systolic pressure ranged from -53.5 mm Hg to +64.5 mm Hg (mean, +17.2 mm Hg). Instead, when 10 mm Hg was added to treated systolic pressure, the additive genetic component rose to 86.6 mm Hg(2) (SE, 10.1). Similar changes were seen in the shared environment component of variance for systolic pressure and for the combined genetic and shared environmental (ie, familial) components of diastolic pressure. There was little change in the individual-specific variance component across any of the methods. Therefore, treated subjects contribute important information to the familial components of blood pressure variance. This information is lost if treated subjects are excluded and obscured by treatment effects if unadjusted measured pressures are used. Adding back an appropriate increment of pressure restores familial components, more closely reflects the pretreatment values, and should increase the power of genomic linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate i) the frequency of typical hypothyroidism symptoms in children with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), ii) to evaluate the association of SH with lipoproteins and iii) to investigate possible improving effects of L-thyroxine (LT4) treatment on these findings. METHODS: Twenty-seven children with SH who had elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH: {\textgreater}4.94 µIU/L) but normal free T4 levels and healthy euthyroid children of similar age and sex were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric and laboratory (lipid profile and thyroid function tests) measurements were performed at diagnosis and six months after euthyroidism was achieved. All children were also subjected to a questionnaire on hypothyroid symptoms at diagnosis. The SH patients were subjected to the questionnaire also following treatment. Pre-treatment data were compared with those of controls and post-treatment measurements. RESULTS: Anthropometric and laboratory parameters of the groups were not statistically different except for higher TSH levels in the SH group. Serum lipoprotein levels and dyslipidemia frequency were similar between the groups. Compared to the controls, hypothyroidism symptom score was significantly higher in the SH group. Six months after euthyroidism was achieved, a significant reduction in the hypothyroid symptom score was obtained in the SH group. Except for significantly higher serum TSH values, no significant differences regarding demographic characteristics, symptom scores and lipid parameters were present between patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the remaining SH patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that in children with SH i) the hypothyroidism symptom score was significantly higher than in euthyroid children, ii) LT4 treatment improved the hypothyroidism symptom score and iii) SH does not seem to be associated with dyslipidemia.},

The exclusion of subjects with elevated thyroid antibodies had no effect on the FT4 reference interval in either gender or on the TSH reference interval in men. Among women, the exclusion of 196 (34\%) thyroid antibody-positive subjects resulted in lowering of the upper reference limit of TSH from 7.2 to 5.8 mIU/L. When the more stringent "mode-method" by summing mode+(mode-2.5th percentile) was used, 334 women (58\%) were excluded and the upper reference limit of TSH remained essentially identical.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The distribution of serum TSH shifts progressively to higher concentrations with age. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether the population shift in TSH distribution to higher concentrations with aging extends to people of exceptional longevity, namely centenarians, and to assess the relationship between concentrations of TSH and free T(4) (FT4). DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: We analyzed TSH, FT4, and TSH frequency distribution curves in thyroid disease-free Ashkenazi Jews with exceptional longevity (centenarians; median age, 98 yr), in younger Ashkenazi controls (median age, 72 yr), and in a population of thyroid disease-free individuals (median age, 68 yr) from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1998-2002 (NHANES controls). RESULTS: Serum TSH was significantly higher in centenarians [1.97 (0.42-7.15) mIU/liter] than in Ashkenazi controls [1.55 (0.46-4.55) mIU/liter] and NHANES controls [1.61 (0.39-6.29) mIU/liter] (median, 2.5 and 97.5 centiles) (P {\textless} 0.001). The TSH frequency distribution curve of centenarians was relatively similar in shape to controls but shifted significantly to higher TSH, including TSH concentration at peak frequency. The TSH distribution curve of the NHANES control group was superimposable to and not significantly different from the Ashkenazi controls. FT4 was similar in centenarians and Ashkenazi controls, and there was a significant inverse correlation between FT4 and TSH in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The TSH population shifts to higher concentrations with age appear to be a continuum that extends even to people with exceptional longevity. The inverse correlation between TSH and FT4 in our populations suggests that changes in negative feedback may contribute to exceptional longevity.},

	abstract = {It appears to be an association between hypothyroidism and hypertension. However, the relation between thyroid function and blood pressure within the normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) range is uncertain. In the fifth Tromso study, which is a population-based health survey, serum TSH and blood pressure were measured. This gave us the opportunity to test the hypothesis of a relation between serum TSH and blood pressure within the normal serum TSH range. In all 5872 subjects (2623 male subjects) not using blood pressure or thyroxine medication were included in the present study. Within the normal serum TSH range (0.20-4.00 mIU/l), there was a significant and positive relation between serum TSH and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Within this range, and adjusted for age, body mass index and smoking status, the systolic blood pressure was 1.4 mm Hg and the diastolic 1.6 mm Hg higher in male subjects in the highest versus those in the lowest serum TSH quartile. The corresponding differences in the female subjects were 4.0 and 2.7 mm Hg, respectively. When dividing this cohort in those with systolic ({\textgreater}160 mm Hg) and diastolic ({\textgreater}95 mm Hg) hypertension, serum TSH was higher in the hypertensive subjects, but the differences were only statistically significant for diastolic hypertension (serum TSH 1.88+/-0.82 versus 1.69+/-0.74 mIU/l for male subjects, and 1.79+/-0.78 versus 1.63+/-0.75 mIU/l for female subjects, P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, there is a modest, but significant positive association between serum TSH and blood pressure within the normal serum TSH range.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is produced by cardiomyocytes and atherosclerotic lesions under stress conditions. Although higher circulating GDF-15 concentrations are associated with mortality across a spectrum of cardiovascular conditions, the relationship of GDF-15 with atherosclerosis and mortality in the general population remains undefined.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We measured plasma GDF-15 in 3219 participants of the Dallas Heart Study, a population sample of adults ages 30-65 years (55\% women, 49\% black). GDF-15 was analyzed in prespecified categories ({\textless}1200; 1200-1799; and ≥1800 ng/L) and continuously. End points included prevalent coronary artery calcium (CAC{\textgreater}10 Agatston units), increased CAC (CAC≥100 Agatston units) by electron beam computed tomography, and mortality through a median 7.3 years of follow-up (120 deaths, 48 cardiovascular deaths).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Increasing GDF-15 associated with older age, black race, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, left ventricular (LV) mass/body surface area, and worse renal function (P{\textless}0.0001 for each). In multivariable models adjusted for traditional risk factors, renal function, and LV mass/body surface area, GDF-15≥1800 ng/L was associated with CAC{\textgreater}10 (odds ratio 2.1; 95\% CI 1.2-3.7; P=0.01), CAC≥100 (odds ratio 2.6; 95\% CI 1.4-4.9; P=0.002), all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 3.5; 95\% CI 2.1-5.9, P{\textless}0.0001), and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 2.5; 95\% CI 1.1-5.8, P=0.03). Adding log GDF-15 to fully adjusted models modestly improved the c statistic (P=0.025), the integrated discrimination index (0.028; P{\textless}0.0001) and the category-less net reclassification index (0.42; P=0.002). These findings remained significant with further adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin T.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is independently associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and mortality, and its potential role for risk stratification in the general population merits further evaluation.},

	abstract = {Biomechanical stress ie, attributable to pressure overload, leads to cardiac hypertrophy and may ultimately cause heart failure. Yet, it is still unclear how mechanical stress is sensed and transduced on the molecular level. To systematically elucidate the underlying signal transduction pathways, we analyzed the gene expression profile of stretched cardiomyocytes on a genome-wide scale in comparison with other inducers of hypertrophy such as pharmacological stimulation. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were either stretched biaxially or stimulated with phenylephrine (PE), both resulting in a similar degree of hypertrophy. Microarray analyses revealed 164 genes {\textgreater}2.0-fold up- and 21 genes {\textless}0.5-fold downregulated (P{\textless}0.01). Differential expression was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genes of the "fetal gene program" such as BNP were induced by both stretch (4.2x) and PE (2.9x). We also verified upregulation of known stretch-responsive genes, including HSP70 (20.9x) and c-myc (3.0x). Moreover, several genes were found to be preferentially induced by stretch, such as the cardioprotective cytokine GDF15 (24.8x) and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1, 10.8x; both confirmed on protein level). Neither PE nor endothelin-1 upregulated GDF15 and Hmox1, whereas angiotensin II significantly induced both genes. Conversely, the AT(1) receptor blocker irbesartan markedly blunted stretch-mediated GDF15 and Hmox1 upregulation, suggesting that the angiotensin receptor transduces the biomechanical induction of these genes. In conclusion, we report a comprehensive gene expression profile of cardiomyocytes subjected to biomechanical stress in comparison with pharmacologically induced hypertrophy. Our data imply that a stretch-specific gene program exists, which is mediated, at least in part, by angiotensin II-dependent signaling.},

	abstract = {Data from the Women's Health Study show that serum levels of growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a distant member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, are an independent risk indicator for adverse cardiovascular events. However, the cellular sources, upstream regulators, and functional effects of GDF-15 in the cardiovascular system have not been elucidated. We have identified GDF-15 by cDNA expression array analysis as a gene that is strongly upregulated by nitrosative stress in cultured cardiomyocytes isolated from 1- to 3-day-old rats. GDF-15 mRNA and pro-peptide expression levels were also induced in cardiomyocytes subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) via NO-peroxynitrite-dependent signaling pathways. GDF-15 was actively secreted into the culture supernatant, suggesting that it might exert autocrine/paracrine effects during I/R. To explore the in vivo relevance of these findings, mice were subjected to transient or permanent coronary artery ligation. Myocardial GDF-15 mRNA and pro-peptide abundance rapidly increased in the area-at-risk after ischemic injury. Similarly, patients with an acute myocardial infarction had enhanced myocardial GDF-15 pro-peptide expression levels. As shown by immunohistochemistry, cardiomyocytes in the ischemic area contributed significantly to the induction of GDF-15 in the infarcted human heart. To delineate the function of GDF-15 during I/R, Gdf-15 gene-targeted mice were subjected to transient coronary artery ligation for 1 hour followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Gdf-15-deficient mice developed greater infarct sizes and displayed more cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the infarct border zone after I/R compared with wild-type littermates, indicating that endogenous GDF-15 limits myocardial tissue damage in vivo. Moreover, treatment with recombinant GDF-15 protected cultured cardiomyocytes from apoptosis during simulated I/R as shown by histone ELISA, TUNEL/Hoechst staining, and annexin V/propidium iodide fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Mechanistically, the prosurvival effects of GDF-15 in cultured cardiomyocytes were abolished by phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase inhibitors and adenoviral expression of dominant-negative Akt1 (K179M mutation). In conclusion, our study identifies induction of GDF-15 in the heart as a novel defense mechanism that protects from I/R injury.},

We have now investigated GDF-15/MIC-1 in human MPhi after exposure to oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) related mediators in vitro and in arteriosclerotic carotid arteries. Using RT-PCR and Western blotting a pronounced induction of GDF-15/MIC-1 expression by oxLDL, C6-ceramide, tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was found in cultured human MPhi. In 11 human arteriosclerotic carotid arteries, immunohistochemical analyses supported by computer-assisted morphometry and regression analyses demonstrated a significant colocalization of GDF-15/MIC-1 immunoreactivity (IR) with oxLDL IR and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) IR in CD68 immunoreactive (ir) MPhi, which were also expressing AIF-IR (apoptosis-inducing factor), caspase-3-IR (CPP32), PARP-IR, c-Jun/AP-1-IR and p53-IR. Our data suggest that GDF-15/MIC-1 is inducible in human MPhi by oxLDL and its mediators in vitro and is supposed to contribute to oxidative stress dependent consequences in arteriosclerotic plaques, e.g. modulating apoptosis and inflammatory processes in activated MPhi.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is emerging as a prognostic biomarker in patients with coronary artery disease. Little is known about GDF-15 as a biomarker in patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: The circulating concentration of GDF-15 was measured at baseline (n=1734) and at 12 months (n=1517) in patients randomized in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT). GDF-15 levels at baseline ranged from 259 to 25 637 ng/L and were abnormally high ({\textgreater}1200 ng/L) in 85\% of patients. Higher levels were associated with features of worse heart failure and biomarkers of neurohormonal activation, inflammation, myocyte injury, and renal dysfunction. Baseline GDF-15 levels (per 100 ng/L) were associated with the risks of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.017; 95\% confidence interval, 1.014 to 1.019; P{\textless}0.001) and first morbid event (hazard ratio, 1.020; 95\% confidence interval, 1.017 to 1.023; P{\textless}0.001). In a comprehensive multiple-variable Cox regression model that included clinical prognostic variables, B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity troponin T, GDF-15 remained independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.007; 95\% confidence interval, 1.001 to 1.014; P=0.02) but not first morbid event. At 12 months, the GDF-15 levels had increased by a similar amount in the placebo and valsartan groups (P=0.94). Increases in GDF-15 over 12 months were independently associated with the risks of future mortality and first morbid event also after adjustment for clinical prognostic variables, B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity troponin T and their changes. CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 reflects information from several pathological pathways and provides independent prognostic information in heart failure. GDF-15 levels increase over time, suggesting that GDF-15 reflects a pathophysiological axis that is not completely addressed by the therapies prescribed in Val-HeFT.},

With the publication of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment Panel (ATP-III)1 in 2001 and similar guidelines from other national and international bodies,2–5 risk prediction assumed a central role in the field of CVD prevention. Since then, numerous attempts have been made to refine and improve risk assessment methods. A basic review of the history and principles of risk prediction, their statistical underpinnings, and their clinical implications is thus required to help clinicians and researchers understand the increasingly complex approaches being undertaken to refine CVD risk prediction.

	abstract = {Background: Results of previous randomised trials have shown that interventions that lower LDL cholesterol concentrations can significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other major vascular events in a wide range of individuals. But each separate trial has limited power to assess particular outcomes or particular categories of participant. Methods: A prospective meta-analysis of data from 90 056 individuals in 14 randomised trials of statins was done. Weighted estimates were obtained of effects on different clinical outcomes per 1??0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. Findings: During a mean of 5 years, there were 8186 deaths, 14 348 individuals had major vascular events, and 5103 developed cancer. Mean LDL cholesterol differences at 1 year ranged from 0??35 mmol/L to 1??77 mmol/L (mean 1??09) in these trials. There was a 12\% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (rate ratio [RR] 0??88, 95\% CI 0??84-0??91; p{\textless}0??0001). This reflected a 19\% reduction in coronary mortality (0??81, 0??76-0??85; p{\textless}0??0001), and non-significant reductions in non-coronary vascular mortality (0??93, 0??83-1??03; p=0??2) and non-vascular mortality (0??95, 0??90-1??01; p=0??1). There were corresponding reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0??77, 0??74-0??80; p{\textless}0??0001), in the need for coronary revascularisation (0??76, 0??73-0??80; p{\textless}0??0001), in fatal or non-fatal stroke (0??83, 0??78-0??88; p{\textless}0??0001), and, combining these, of 21\% in any such major vascular event (0??79, 0??77-0??81; p{\textless}0??0001). The proportional reduction in major vascular events differed significantly (p{\textless}0??0001) according to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved, but not otherwise. These benefits were significant within the first year, but were greater in subsequent years. Taking all years together, the overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction translated into 48 (95\% CI 39-57) fewer participants having major vascular events per 1000 among those with pre-existing CHD at baseline, compared with 25 (19-31) per 1000 among participants with no such history. There was no evidence that statins increased the incidence of cancer overall (1??00, 0??95-1??06; p=0??9) or at any particular site. Interpretation: Statin therapy can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke by about one fifth per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, largely irrespective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting characteristics. The absolute benefit relates chiefly to an individual's absolute risk of such events and to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved. These findings reinforce the need to consider prolonged statin treatment with substantial LDL cholesterol reductions in all patients at high risk of any type of major vascular event.},

The Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Working Group members are international leaders in teaching critical appraisal skills, and their users’ guides for appraising the validity of the healthcare literature2 have long been the basis of teaching programmes worldwide. However, we found that many of our students took a reductionist ‘‘paint by numbers’’ approach when using the Working Group’s guides. Students could answer individual appraisal questions correctly but would have difficulty assessing overall study quality. We believe this is due to a poor understanding of epidemiological study design. So over the past 15 years of teaching critical appraisal we have modified the EBM Working Group approach and developed the Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiological studies (GATE) frame to help our students conceptualise the whole study as well as its component parts. GATE is a visual framework that illustrates the generic design of all epidemiological studies (figure 1). We now teach critical appraisal by ‘‘hanging’’ studies and the EBM Working Group’s appraisal questions on the GATE frame. This editorial outlines the GATE approach to critical appraisal, illustrated throughout using the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a rando- mised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of the effect of daily oestrogen plus progestin on coronary heart disease (CHD) death in postmenopausal women.3 A detailed critical appraisal of HERS using a GATE-based checklist is available online.4},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Data on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality are conflicting. PURPOSE To summarize prospective evidence about the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and CHD and mortality. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (1950 to January 2008) without language restrictions and reference lists of retrieved articles were searched. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers screened and selected cohort studies that measured thyroid function and then followed persons prospectively to assess CHD or mortality. DATA EXTRACTION By using a standardized protocol and forms, 2 reviewers independently abstracted and assessed studies. DATA SYNTHESIS Ten of 12 identified studies involved population-based cohorts that included 14 449 participants. All 10 population-based cohort studies examined risks associated with subclinical hypothyroidism (2134 CHD events and 2822 deaths), whereas only 5 examined risks associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism (1392 CHD events and 1993 deaths). In a random-effects model, the relative risk (RR) for subclinical hypothyroidism for CHD was 1.20 (95\% CI, 0.97 to 1.49; P for heterogeneity = 0.14; I(2 )= 33.4\%). Risk estimates were lower when higher-quality studies were pooled (RR, 1.02 to 1.08) and were higher among participants younger than 65 years (RR, 1.51 [CI, 1.09 to 2.09] for studies with mean participant age {\textless}65 years and 1.05 [CI, 0.90 to 1.22] for studies with mean participant age {\textgreater} or =65 years). The RR was 1.18 (CI, 0.98 to 1.42) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.12 (CI, 0.99 to 1.26) for total mortality. For subclinical hyperthyroidism, the RR was 1.21 (CI, 0.88 to 1.68) for CHD, 1.19 (CI, 0.81 to 1.76) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.12 (CI, 0.89 to 1.42) for total mortality (P for heterogeneity {\textgreater}0.50; I(2 )= 0\% for all studies). LIMITATIONS Individual studies adjusted for different potential confounders, and 1 study provided only unadjusted data. Publication bias or selective reporting of outcomes could not be excluded. CONCLUSION Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism may be associated with a modest increased risk for CHD and mortality, with lower risk estimates when pooling higher-quality studies and larger CIs for subclinical hyperthyroidism.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with elevated cholesterol and increased risk for atherosclerosis, but data on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) are conflicting. We performed a systematic review to determine whether subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with CHD in adults. Methods: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to April 2005, and the bibliographies of key articles to identify studies that provided risk estimates for CHD or cardiovascular mortality associated with subclinical hypothyroidism. Two authors independently reviewed each potential study for eligibility, assessed methodologic quality, and extracted the data. Results: We identified 14 observational studies that met eligibility criteria. Subclinical hypothyroidism increased the risk of CHD (summary odds ratio [OR]: 1.65, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.12). The summary OR for CHD was 1.81 (CI, 1.38-2.39) in 9 studies adjusted or matched for demographic characteristics, and 2.38 (CI, 1.53-3.69) after pooling the studies that adjusted for most cardiovascular risk factors. Sensitivity analyses including only population-based studies and those with formal outcome adjudication procedures yielded similar results. Subgroup analyses by type of study design showed a similar trend, but lower risk, in the 5 prospective cohort studies (OR 1.42, CI, 0.91-2.21), compared with the case-control and cross-sectional studies (OR 1.72, CI, 1.25-2.38). Conclusion: Our systematic review indicates that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of CHD. Clinical trials are needed to assess whether thyroxine replacement reduces the risk of CHD in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results were compared across two groups based on the minimum age of participants studied (younger than 65 yr and 65 yr or older).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDATA SYNTHESIS: There were 15 studies included for analysis with 2,531 SCH participants and 26,491 euthyroid individuals. IHD incidence and prevalence were higher in SCH subjects compared with euthyroid participants from studies including those younger than 65 yr, but not studies of subjects aged older than 65 yr [odds ratio (95\% confidence interval)]: 1.57 (1.19-2.06) vs. 1.01 (0.87-1.18) and 1.68 (1.27-2.23) vs. 1.02 (0.85-1.22), respectively. Cardiovascular/all-cause mortality was also elevated in participants from the younger than 65-yr studies, but not from the studies of older people: odds ratio 1.37 (1.04-1.79) vs. 0.85 (0.56-1.29). Prevalent IHD was higher in SCH participants of both genders, although this was statistically significant only in women.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: SCH is associated with increased IHD (both prevalence and incidence) and cardiovascular mortality only in subjects from younger populations.

	abstract = {Lowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy. We undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39 612 individuals; median follow-up 5??1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129 526 individuals; median follow-up 4??8 years). For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1??0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation. In the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0??51 mmol/L. Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15 (95 CI 11-18; p{\textless}0??0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13 (95 CI 7-19; p{\textless}0??0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19 (95 CI 15-24; p{\textless}0??0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16 (95 CI 5-26; p=0??005). Per 1??0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control. When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1??0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0??78, 95 CI 0??76-0??80; p{\textless}0??0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen. Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10 per 1??0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0??90, 95 CI 0??87-0??93; p{\textless}0??0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0??80, 99 CI 0??74-0??87; p{\textless}0??0001) and other cardiac causes (RR 0??89, 99 CI 0??81-0??98; p=0??002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0??96, 95 CI 0??84-1??09; p=0??5) or other vascular causes (RR 0??98, 99 CI 0??81-1??18; p=0??8). No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes (RR 0??97, 95 CI 0??92-1??03; p=0??3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1??00, 95 CI 0??96- 1??04; p=0??9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations. Further reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1??0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth. There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2-3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40-50.

	abstract = {Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.},

Since the types of trials have different aims, they differ significantly in various methodological aspects. The awareness of the methodological differences is generally quite limited.

We investigated whether therapy targeting normal systolic pressure (i.e., {\textless}120 mm Hg) reduces major cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. METHODS: A total of 4733 participants with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to intensive therapy, targeting a systolic pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, or standard therapy, targeting a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg. The primary composite outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years. RESULTS: After 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 119.3 mm Hg in the intensive-therapy group and 133.5 mm Hg in the standard-therapy group. The annual rate of the primary outcome was 1.87\% in the intensive-therapy group and 2.09\% in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio with intensive therapy, 0.88; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.06; P=0.20). The annual rates of death from any cause were 1.28\% and 1.19\% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.35; P=0.55). The annual rates of stroke, a prespecified secondary outcome, were 0.32\% and 0.53\% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.89; P=0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, did not reduce the rate of a composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events.

METHODS We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65\% per year vs. 2.19\% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P{\textless}0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0·50-1·4 mU/l. However, thyroid function was not associated with the risk of being hospitalized with myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS High serum TSH was associated with increased mortality from coronary heart disease in women, but we found no association of thyroid function with the risk of being hospitalized with myocardial infarction. Thus, the morbidity finding does not confirm the suggestion that low thyroid function within the clinically normal range is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Data regarding the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease outcomes are conflicting among large prospective cohort studies. This might reflect differences in participants' age, sex, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, or preexisting cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE To assess the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1950 to May 31, 2010) were searched without language restrictions for prospective cohort studies with baseline thyroid function and subsequent CHD events, CHD mortality, and total mortality. The reference lists of retrieved articles also were searched. DATA EXTRACTION Individual data on 55,287 participants with 542,494 person-years of follow-up between 1972 and 2007 were supplied from 11 prospective cohorts in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, and Japan. The risk of CHD events was examined in 25,977 participants from 7 cohorts with available data. Euthyroidism was defined as a TSH level of 0.50 to 4.49 mIU/L. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level of 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with normal thyroxine concentrations. RESULTS Among 55,287 adults, 3450 had subclinical hypothyroidism (6.2\%) and 51,837 had euthyroidism. During follow-up, 9664 participants died (2168 of CHD), and 4470 participants had CHD events (among 7 studies). The risk of CHD events and CHD mortality increased with higher TSH concentrations. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio (HR) for CHD events was 1.00 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.18) for a TSH level of 4.5 to 6.9 mIU/L (20.3 vs 20.3/1000 person-years for participants with euthyroidism), 1.17 (95\% CI, 0.96-1.43) for a TSH level of 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L (23.8/1000 person-years), and 1.89 (95\% CI, 1.28-2.80) for a TSH level of 10 to 19.9 mIU/L (n = 70 events/235; 38.4/1000 person-years; P {\textless}.001 for trend). The corresponding HRs for CHD mortality were 1.09 (95\% CI, 0.91-1.30; 5.3 vs 4.9/1000 person-years for participants with euthyroidism), 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.95; 6.9/1000 person-years), and 1.58 (95\% CI, 1.10-2.27, n = 28 deaths/333; 7.7/1000 person-years; P = .005 for trend). Total mortality was not increased among participants with subclinical hypothyroidism. Results were similar after further adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Risks did not significantly differ by age, sex, or preexisting cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of CHD events and CHD mortality in those with higher TSH levels, particularly in those with a TSH concentration of 10 mIU/L or greater.},

Hypothyroidism is associated with an increase in a number of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and elevated levels of homocysteine. Our objective was to assess the effects of hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: {\textgreater}10 μ U/mL), moderate subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH; TSH: 6.1-10 μ U/mL), and mild SCH (TSH: 3.1-6.0 μ U/mL) on cardiovascular risk factors, CHD prevalence, and all-cause mortality in patients at high risk for CHD seen in a preventive cardiology clinic.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: All patients seen in the Cleveland Clinic Preventive Cardiology clinic have demographic and laboratory tests including TSH and multiple CHD risk factors obtained at the baseline visit. All data are entered into a database (called PreCIS). The social security death index is queried monthly to determine all-cause mortality.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Several CHD risk factors including age, male gender, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and fibrinogen were more common in hypothyroid patients. Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients. All-cause mortality was higher in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients, but not in mild SCH patients. Higher mortality in these groups was observed in both genders, patients under 65 years of age, and patients not on thyroid replacement therapy, but was not observed in patients over 65 years of age.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism and moderate, but not mild, SCH are associated with increased CHD prevalence and all-cause mortality. These observations suggest patients with moderate, but not mild, SCH and patients at high risk for CHD should be treated with thyroid replacement therapy.},

In a cross-sectional analysis, we investigated the prevalence of STD and its relationship with cardiometabolic profile and cardiovascular disease. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were assessed for participants followed for up to 7.5 years. Association between STD and mortality was drawn using multivariate analysis, adjusting for potential confounders.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A total of 913 (82.3\%) participants had euthyroidism, 99 (8.7\%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 69 (6.2\%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. At baseline, no association was found between STD and cardiometabolic profile or cardiovascular disease. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs (95\% confidence interval)) for all-cause mortality were significantly higher for individuals with both subclinical hyperthyroidism (HR, 3.0 (1.5-5.9); n=14) and subclinical hypothyroidism (HR, 2.3 (1.2-4.4); n=13) than for euthyroid subjects.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Studies of hypothyroidism are often based on referred patients, and limited information is available on the incidence rates of subtypes of hypothyroidism in the general population. We therefore studied incidences of subtypes of primary, overt hypothyroidism in a Danish population cohort and compared incidences in two subcohorts with different levels of iodine intake. DESIGN A prospective population-based study, monitoring a well-defined cohort representative of the Danish population. METHODS The Danish Investigation of Iodine Intake and Thyroid Diseases registry of hyper- and hypothyroidism was established as part of the monitoring of the iodine fortification of salt in Denmark. A computer-based system linked to laboratory databases identified all patients diagnosed with new, biochemically overt hypothyroidism in populations living in Aalborg (moderate iodine deficiency, n = 311,102) and Copenhagen (mild iodine deficiency, n = 227,632). We subsequently evaluated all identified patients to verify incident thyroid disease, and subclassified hypothyroidism into nosological types. RESULTS During a 4-year period (2,027,208 person-years) 685 new cases of overt hypothyroidism were diagnosed in the cohort; the incidence rate was 32.8 per 100,000 person-years (standardised to the Danish population). Nosological types of hypothyroidism were: spontaneous (presumably autoimmune) 84.4\%, post-partum 4.7\%, amiodarone-associated 4.0\%, subacute thyroiditis 1.8\%, previous radiation or surgery 1.8\%, congenital 1.6\% and lithium-associated 1.6\%. Crude incidence rates were 29.0 around Aalborg and 40.6 in an area of Copenhagen. The higher incidence rate of hypothyroidism in the area with higher iodine intake was caused solely by more cases of spontaneous (presumably autoimmune) hypothyroidism, whereas the incidence of non-spontaneous hypothyroidism (all types combined) was significantly lower in the area with higher iodine intake. CONCLUSION In a population-based study we observed a higher incidence of hypothyroidism with higher iodine intake. This was due solely to the entity of spontaneous hypothyroidism. The occurrence of overt hypothyroidism was relatively low in Denmark.},

Twenty references describing BMD and five describing fracture risk were included in the meta-analysis. BMD was significantly decreased in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Upon treatment BMD increased significantly and reversed to normal levels with a temporary increase above normal levels 1-4 years after diagnosis. The risk of hip fractures increased significantly with age at diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The hip fracture risk after diagnosis predicted from studies on BMD was close to that observed in clinical studies comparing fracture risk in hyperthyroid patients with normal controls. Thus BMD is significantly decreased and fracture risk increased in untreated hyperthyroidism.

Based on this, the RR of overall mortality was 1.21 (95\% confidence interval: 1.05-1.38). Analyses including studies considering setting, treatment, and control for co-morbidity did not significantly alter this finding. As the measured heterogeneity (I(2)) ranges from 89.1 to 98.3\%, which is much higher than the 50\% generally viewed on as a threshold, the statistical heterogeneity is very pronounced in the included studies.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, mortality is increased by ∼ 20\%. Future studies need to address the cause of hyperthyroidism, impact of type of therapy, time dependency, as well as the potential influence of confounding or genetic susceptibility before the question of causality can be answered.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Some evidence suggests that high serum TSH levels are associated with an adverse lipid profile, but this association is not clear when plasma TSH is within the reference range. Nevertheless, these studies have never been conducted in Spain, a country with a strong adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The study aim was to analyse the association between blood TSH levels and circulating lipids in a large Spanish population and set up a TSH reference range in different age, gender and Body Mass Index (BMI) subpopulations from our cohort. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study on 20 783 subjects. PATIENTS: We analysed circulating levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and triglycerides (TG) and compared them with TSH serum levels. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine the TSH cut-off level from where hyperlipidaemia developed. RESULTS: In individuals free of thyroid dysfunction, the mean and the 95\% TSH (mU/l) reference limits were 2·20 and 0·72-4·43, respectively. We observed a sex-related difference in TSH concentration (men, 2·07 and 0·72-4·29; women, 2·29 and 0·72-4·49; P {\textless} 0·01). We also observed a weight-related difference in TSH concentration (BMI {\textless} 30 kg/m(2) , 2·16 and 0·72-4·39; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , 2·28 and 0·71-4·47; P {\textless} 0·01). TSH was positively associated with TC, TG and LDLc levels and negatively with HDLc. CONCLUSION: We found an association between TSH and lipids in that as TSH increased, the lipid profile became less favourable, even within the normal range. Additionally, TSH reference ranges varied according to gender, age and BMI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients. METHODS: The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update. RESULTS: Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered. CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.},

	abstract = {The association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes has been recently clarified with the publication of three individual participant data (IPD) analyses from the Thyroid Studies Collaboration. We identified original cohort studies with a systematic review and pooled individual data from over 70'000 participants to obtain a more precise estimate of the risks of cardiovascular outcomes associated with subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as normal thyroxine (FT4) levels with increased or decreased Thyroid-Stimulating Hormones (TSH or thyrotropin) respectively, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes compared to euthyroid state, particularly in those with a more pronounced thyroid dysfunction. Specifically, subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CHD mortality and heart failure (HF) events in individuals with higher TSH levels, particularly in those with TSH levels ≥10.0 mIU/L. Conversely, subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, CHD mortality, HF and atrial fibrillation, particularly in those with suppressed TSH levels {\textless}0.10 mIU/L. Pending ongoing randomized controlled trials, these observational findings allow identifying potential TSH thresholds for thyroid medication initiation based on risk of clinical outcomes, although clinical decision based solely on observational data need caution. The impact of thyroid replacement among the elderly with subclinical hypothyroidism is currently studied in a multicenter international randomized controlled trial (Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial, TRUST trial).},

	abstract = {Background: Reliable and comparable analysis of risks to health is key for preventing disease and injury. Causal attribution of morbidity and mortality to risk factors has traditionally been in the context of individual risk factors, often in a limited number of settings, restricting comparability. Our aim was to estimate the contributions of selected major risk factors to global and regional burden of disease in a unified framework. Methods: For 26 selected risk factors, expert working groups undertook a comprehensive review of published work and other sources - eg, government reports and international databases - to obtain data on the prevalence of risk factor exposure and hazard size for 14 epidemiological regions of the world. Population attributable fractions were estimated by applying the potential impact fraction relation, and applied to the mortality and burden of disease estimates from the global burden of disease (GBD) database. Findings: Childhood and maternal underweight (138 million disability adjusted life years [DALY], 9.5\%), unsafe sex (92 million DALY, 6.3\%), high blood pressure (64 million DALY, 4.4\%), tobacco (59 million DALY, 4.1\%), and alcohol (58 million DALY, 4.0\%) were the leading causes of global burden of disease. In the poorest regions of the world, childhood and maternal underweight, unsafe sex, unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, indoor smoke from solid fuels, and various micronutrient deficiencies were major contributors to loss of healthy life. In both developing and developed regions, alcohol, tobacco, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol were major causes of disease burden. Interpretation: Substantial proportions of global disease burden are attributable to these major risks, to an extent greater than previously estimated. Developing countries suffer most or all of the burden due to many of the leading risks. Strategies that target these known risks can provide substantial and underestimated public-health gains.},

Intraperitoneal doses of 15 micrograms triiodothyronine (T3)/100 g body wt per d caused an increase in caloric intake from 26.5 +/- 1.7 (mean +/- SEM) kcal/100 g per d to 38.1 +/- 1.5 kcal/100 g per d. Food intake, however, rose only after 4-6 d of treatment and was maximal by the 8th day. In contrast, total body basal oxygen consumption rose by 24 h and reached a maximum by 4 d. Since total urinary nitrogen excretion and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA did not rise, gluconeogenesis from protein sources did not supply the needed substrate for the early increase in calorigenesis. Total body fat stores fell approximately 50\% by the 6th day of treatment and could account for the entire increase in caloric expenditure during the initial period of T3 treatment. Total body lipogenesis increased within 1 d and reached a plateau 4-5 d after the start of T3 treatment. 15-19\% of the increased caloric intake was channeled through lipogenesis, assuming glucose to be the sole substrate for lipogenesis. The metabolic cost of the increased lipogenesis, however, accounted for only 3-4\% of the T3-induced increase in calorigenesis. These results suggest that fatty acids derived from adipose tissue are the primary source of substrate for thyroid hormone-induced calorigenesis and that the early increase in lipogenesis serves simply to maintain fat stores. Since the mRNAs coding for lipogenic enzymes rise many hours before oxygen consumption and lipolysis, these results suggest that T3 acts at least in part by an early coordinate induction of the genes responsible for these processes.},

Why are there two thyroid hormone-receptor genes? Is the function of each of the two receptors indeed unique? How T3 receptors interact with other nuclear proteins and DNA-binding sites and how these interactions are influenced by T3 is incompletely understood. The developmental regulatory role of T3 receptor alpha 1 and its non-T3-binding alpha 2 variant needs to be defined. Most T3-regulated processes, especially those related to metabolism, muscle contraction, and brain development, function in concert with a number of other regulatory factors. The therapeutic applications of knowledge gained about the basic mechanisms of thyroid hormone action should ultimately extend beyond thyroid disease to processes regulated or influenced by T3; these include cardiac function, lipid metabolism, pituitary hormone secretion, and neural development.},

We hypothesized that TSH plays an important role in lipid metabolism independent of TH.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between serum TSH levels and lipid profiles after controlling for free T(3), free T(4), total T(3), total T(4) and nonthyroid factors relevant to lipid metabolism in euthyroid Chinese subjects.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: General linear analysis was performed to determine whether the impact of TSH on serum lipid levels is independent of the TH levels. Moreover, path analysis, an evolutionary multivariable regression technique, was conducted to test whether there is a direct and/or indirect effect between serum TSH and total cholesterol (TC) levels. Additionally, the odds ratios (95\% confidence interval) for hypercholesterolemia in relation to TSH categories were calculated.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A total of 3664 euthyroid subjects were finally analyzed. There was a significant linear trend toward higher log TC (P = 0.021) and log triglyceride (P = 0.001) levels with increasing serum TSH levels within the reference range, which remained significant after adjusting for factors such as TH levels, age, and smoking. Most importantly, the total effect of TSH on TC levels (total effect(TC, TSH) = 0.05253) includes a direct effect (direct effect(TC, TSH) = 0.05979) and an indirect effect via TH. Compared with subjects in the lower part of the reference range (TSH level, 0.27-0.61 mIU/liter), the adjusted odds ratio for hypercholesterolemia was 3.239 (95\% confidence interval, 1.392-7.538; P = 0.007) for those in the upper category (TSH level, 4.61-5.5 mIU/liter).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The variation in normal TSH levels is partially related to the lipid components and hypercholesterolemia in euthyroid subjects and includes both TH-dependent and TH-independent effects.

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone has been reported to have significant effects on the peripheral vascular system, including relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and antiatherosclerotic effects. To exert its biological activity, thyroxine, which is a major secretory product of thyroid gland, needs to be converted to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)) by iodothyronine deiodinase. Type I iodothyronine deiodinase (DI) is widely distributed and maintains circulating T(3) level, whereas type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DII) is present in a limited number of tissues to provide local intracellular T(3). In the present study, we have identified iodothyronine deiodinase in cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMCs) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs). All of the characteristics of the deiodinating activity in hCASMCs and hASMCs were compatible with DII. Northern analysis demonstrated that DII mRNA was expressed in both hCASMCs and hASMCs, and DII mRNA levels as well as DII activities were rapidly increased by dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin. These data demonstrate, for the first time, the expression of DII in human vascular smooth muscle cells, which is regulated by a cAMP-mediated mechanism. The present results suggest a previously unrecognized role of local T(3) production by DII in the pathophysiology of human vascular smooth muscle cells.},

	abstract = {Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare cause of hypothyroidism generally related to a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or arising as an iatrogenic complication. In adults, CH may be secondary to quantitative and/or qualitative alterations in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. The disease is difficult to diagnose clinically because it lacks specific clinical signs and these may be masked by other anterior pituitary hormone secretion deficiencies. In patients with long-standing and marked CH, a diagnosis may be made based on low free T4 levels and normal, low or moderately increased TSH levels. In patients with early-stage or moderate CH, exploration of the circadian TSH cycle, determination of TSH response after a TRH test or recombinant TSH injection, estimation of TSH index, or evaluation of peripheral indexes of thyroid hormone metabolism may be required to establish a diagnosis. Regarding treatment, patients should receive levothyroxine replacement therapy, but hormone objectives during follow-up need to be precisely determined in order to reduce cardiovascular risks and to improve the quality of life of patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The systemic hemodynamic profile of human pregnancy is characterized by a decrease in mean arterial pressure, a rise in cardiac output and plasma volume in association with an increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. The factors and the time course responsible for the initial hemodynamic changes seen in human pregnancy have not been completely documented. We hypothesize that systemic and renal hemodynamic changes occur early, prior to the presence of the fetal-placental unit. METHODS: Thirteen women were studied prior to and immediately following conception in identical fashion at gestational weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 36. Individuals underwent mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, inulin and PAH clearance determinations. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure decreased by six weeks gestation (mid follicular 81.5 +/- 2.6 vs. six weeks 68.7 +/- 2.0 mm tig, P {\textless} 0.001) in association with a significant increase in cardiac output, a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in plasma volume. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate increased by six weeks gestation. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration increased significantly by six weeks, whereas norepinephrine levels did not change throughout pregnancy. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels increased later, at 12 weeks gestation. Plasma cGMP levels decreased and cGMP clearance increased by six and eight weeks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral vasodilation occurs early in pregnancy prior to full placentation in association with renal vasodilation and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma volume expansion occurs early, followed later by increases in ANP concentration, suggesting that ANP increases in response to changes in intravasular volume.},

Improvements in TSH assays have led to better definition of the lower limit of the reference range, but the upper limit of the range for a healthy population is currently a topic of some debate. Population studies have improved our understanding of the clinical implications of elevated serum TSH concentrations in terms of future progression to hypothyroidism, but have not yet fully elucidated the correlation of modestly elevated TSH levels with long-term morbidity. This paper will review the current debate including the arguments for and against reducing the upper limit of the TSH range, whether such a level should be based on evidence from epidemiological studies, and the implications of categorizing large numbers of people with subclinical hypothyroidism. The impact of using different methodologies for the measurement of TSH and the inherent variability of results on reference ranges is also discussed. We argue that the reference range for TSH should be assay-specific and be determined by standard techniques in normal populations as recommended by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry. In contrast, we suggest that a decision level be determined separately from epidemiological studies to identify a population with subclinical hypothyroidism. Serial monitoring of TSH in this population deserves further study as a means of identifying those at risk of progressing to frank hypothyroidism and meriting treatment.},

	abstract = {Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have pinpointed different single nucleotide polymorphisms consistently associated with blood pressure (BP) and hypertension prevalence. However, little data exist regarding single nucleotide polymorphisms predicting BP variation over time and hypertension incidence. The aim of this study was to confirm the association of a genetic risk score (GRS), based on 29 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms, with cross-sectional BP and hypertension prevalence and to challenge its prediction of BP change over time and hypertension incidence in {\textgreater}17 000 middle-aged Swedes participating in a prospective study, the Malmo Preventive Project, investigated at baseline and over a 23-year average period of follow-up. The GRS was associated with higher systolic and diastolic BP values both at baseline (beta +/- SEM, 0.968 +/- 0.102 mm Hg and 0.585 +/- 0.064 mm Hg; P{\textless}1E-19 for both) and at reinvestigation (beta +/- SEM, 1.333 +/- 0.161 mm Hg and 0.724 +/- 0.086 mm Hg; P{\textless}1E-15 for both) and with increased hypertension prevalence (odds ratio [95\% CI], 1.192 [1.140-1.245] and 1.144 [1.107-1.183]; P{\textless}1E-15 for both).

The relative weight of the GRS was lower in magnitude than obesity or prehypertension, but comparable with diabetes mellitus or a positive family history of hypertension. A C-statistics analysis does not show any improvement in the prediction of incident hypertension on top of traditional risk factors. Our data from a large cohort study show that a GRS is independently associated with BP increase and incidence of hypertension.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypothyroidism is a common disorder and while the association of overt hypothyroidism with hypercholesterolaemia is clear, the effect upon lipids of the minor abnormalities of thyroid function often found in those receiving T4 replacement therapy is unclear. The aim of the present studies was to define in those with hypothyroidism the effect upon circulating lipids of subtle changes in thyroid status, indicated by serum TSH values below or above the normal range. DESIGN: (i) Prospective study of short-term T4 treatment of those with subclinical hypothyroidism. (ii) Cross-sectional study of long-term T4 treatment, comparing non-T4 treated controls and T4 treated patients with serum TSH values either below or within the normal range. PATIENTS: Short-term T4 therapy was examined in 11 post-menopausal females with subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH, normal free T4) studied before therapy and 6 weeks after T4 at incremental doses (50, 100, 150 micrograms/day). Long-term T4 treatment for hypothyroidism was investigated in 105 females on therapy for at least 1 year compared with 105 controls matched for age and menopausal status. MEASUREMENTS: Fasting levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL subfractions were determined in patients and controls. RESULTS: (i) T4 treatment of subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism resulted in reductions in total and LDL cholesterol with increasing T4 dose (P {\textless} 0.001). Comparison of lipid results pretreatment with those when TSH was restored to normal revealed no significant difference in lipids; in contrast, comparison of lipids in those with normal TSH compared with the same subjects when TSH was suppressed revealed reductions in total and LDL cholesterol. (ii) Long-term T4 treatment was associated with a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol measurements in those over 55 years receiving suppressive doses of T4 but no significant difference in lipids in those with normal serum TSH compared with non-T4 treated controls. CONCLUSION: Effects of T4 upon lipid measurements suggest that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism should receive replacement therapy. Doses of T4 which suppress TSH to below normal may have a more significant influence upon lipids than doses of T4 which restore TSH to the normal range.},

SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand one hundred seventy-one men and women aged 23 to 102. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring plasma concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3). Cognition was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Prevalence of overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction was evaluated in different age groups ( or =65). Age trends in TSH, FT4, and FT3 were examined in euthyroid participants. The cross-sectional association between thyroid dysfunction and MMSE score was evaluated adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism were more prevalent in older than in younger participants (subclinical hypothyroidism, 3.5\% vs 0.4\%, P{\textless}.03; subclinical hyperthyroidism, 7.8\% vs 1.9\%, P{\textless}.002). In euthyroid participants, TSH and FT3 declined with age, whereas FT4 increased. Older participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism had lower MMSE scores than euthyroid subjects (22.61+/-6.88 vs 24.72+/-4.52, P{\textless}.03). In adjusted analyses, participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism were significantly more likely to have cognitive dysfunction (hazard rate=2.26, P=.003). CONCLUSION: Subtle age-related changes in FT3, FT4, and TSH occur in individuals who remain euthyroid. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is the most prevalent thyroid dysfunction in Italian older persons and is associated with cognitive impairment.},

It is unclear whether thyroid hormone levels within the normal range are also associated with atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC). APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 41 403 apparently healthy young and middle-aged men and women with normal thyroid hormone levels. Free thyroxin, free triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. CAC score was measured by multidetector computed tomography. The multivariable adjusted CAC ratios comparing the highest versus the lowest quartile of thyroid hormones were 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.60-0.91; P for trend 0) comparing the highest versus the lowest quartiles of thyroid hormones were 0.87 (0.79-0.96; P for linear trend {\textless}0.001) for free thyroxin, 0.90 (0.82-0.99; P for linear trend=0.02) for free triiodothyronine, and 0.91 (0.83-1.00; P for linear trend=0.03) for thyroid-stimulating hormone. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of apparently healthy young and middle-aged euthyroid men and women, low-normal free thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone were associated with a higher prevalence of subclinical coronary artery disease and with a greater degree of coronary calcification.},

METHODS: We used 489 heparinized blood samples, collected in the morning, from the Nordic NOBIDA reference material, from healthy adults without medication. TSH, thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, free triiodothyronine, and thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg-ab) were measured using assays for Roche Modular E170 and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) were measured using the Brahms Kryptor assay. RESULTS: The measured concentrations for the thyroid hormones, but not TSH, followed a Gaussian distribution. There were more TPO-ab and Tg-ab positive women than men. After exclusion of the TPO-ab and the Tg-ab positive individuals, the reference interval TSH was 0.64 (0.61-0.72) to 4.7 (4.4-5.0) mIU/L. The exclusion of these ab-positive samples also minimized the differences in TSH concentrations between the sexes and the different Nordic countries. For the thyroid hormones, there were only minor differences between the reference intervals between the Nordic populations and between men and women. These reference intervals were unaffected by removal of the TPO-ab and TG-ab positive samples. CONCLUSIONS: The upper limit of the TSH reference interval in our study is high compared to some other recent reports. This could be due to blood sampling in the morning. Furthermore, the Roche platform gives slightly higher results than other platforms. The number and distribution of the samples in the NOBIDA material makes it suitable for the determination of hormone Nordic reference intervals.},

METHODS: 12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3-10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. FINDINGS: Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.

These tumors are characterized by high levels of circulating free thyroid hormones (FT4 and FT3) in the presence of nonsuppressed serum TSH concentrations. Failure to correctly diagnose TSHomas may result in inappropriate thyroid ablation, which results in a significant increase of pituitary tumor mass. The diagnosis is mainly achieved by measuring TSH after T3 suppression and TRH stimulation tests. These dynamic tests, together with pituitary imaging and genetic testing are useful in distinguishing TSHomas from the syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone action. The treatment of choice is surgery. In cases of surgical failure, somatostatin analogs have been found to be effective in normalizing TSH secretion in more than 90\% of patients.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Endothelial dysfunction is an initial and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis, a later step of atherosclerosis. Hypothyroidism accelerates atherosclerosis. However, the early events responsible for this pro-atherosclerotic effect are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were resistant to induction of atherosclerosis by high cholesterol diet alone, but became susceptible in hypothyroid state achieved by administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) for 6 weeks. VSMC dysfunction and apoptosis were obvious within 1 week after PTU treatment, without signs of endothelial dysfunction. This early VSMC damage was caused by hypothyroidism but not the high cholesterol diet. In ApoE knockout mice, PTU-induced hypothyroidism triggered early VSMC apoptosis, increased oxidative stress, and accelerated atherosclerosis development. Thyroid hormone supplementation (T4, 10, or 50 mug/kg) prevented atherogenic phenotypes in hypothyroid rats and mice. In rats, thyroidectomy caused severe hypothyroidism 5 days after operation, which also led to rapid VSMC dysfunction and apoptosis. In vitro studies did not show a direct toxic effect of PTU on VSMCs. In contrast, thyroid hormone (T3, 0.75 mug/L plus T4, 50 nmol/L) exerted a direct protection against VSMC apoptosis, which was reduced by knockdown of TRalpha1, rather than TRbeta1 and TRbeta2 receptors. TRalpha1-mediated inhibition of apoptotic signalling of JNKs and caspase-3 contributed to the anti-apoptotic action of thyroid hormone. CONCLUSION: These findings provide an in vivo example for VSMC apoptosis as an early trigger of hypothyroidism-associated atherosclerosis, and reveal activation of TRalpha1 receptors to prevent VSMC apoptosis as a therapeutic strategy in this disease.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The association between thyroid hormones within the euthyroid range and metabolic syndrome is not clear. AIM: This study evaluated the relationship between thyroid hormones and metabolic syndrome and its components in euthyroid subjects. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a cross-sectional population based study conducted within the framework of the cohort of the Tehran Thyroid Study. PARTICIPANTS: Out of 5786 subjects aged {\textgreater}/=20 years, 3755 euthyroid subjects without a history of thyroid disorders, diabetes, or use of steroids or lipid-lowering agents were investigated. OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight, waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, free T4 (FT4), and thyrotropin (TSH) were assayed. Metabolic syndrome was determined by definition of the Joint Interim Statement adjusted for the Iranian population. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, and smoking, serum FT4 was significantly associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), WC, systolic BP, and diastolic BP; the associations that remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and the homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) except for HDL-C. Serum TSH was associated only with TGs after adjustments for age, sex, smoking, and BMI, an association that disappeared after further adjustment for HOMA-IR. Serum FT4 was negatively associated (beta=-0.02, 95\% confidence interval [CI: -0.03, -0.01]) and TSH was positively associated (beta=0.03 [CI: 0.01, 0.04) with insulin resistance. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome decreased from 30.1\% in the lowest FT4 tertile to 22.4\% in the highest FT4 tertile (p{\textless}0.001). The prevalence of other metabolic syndrome components decreased significantly from higher to lower FT4 tertiles. Higher FT4 values were associated with lower odds of metabolic syndrome (OR=0.96 [95\% CI: 0.92, 0.99]; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: In euthyroid subjects, FT4, rather than TSH, is associated with risk of metabolic syndrome and its components.},

	abstract = {The Finnish population in Northern Europe has been a target of extensive genetic studies during the last decades. The population is considered as a homogeneous isolate, well suited for gene mapping studies because of its reduced diversity and homogeneity. However, several studies have shown substantial differences between the eastern and western parts of the country, especially in the male-mediated Y chromosome. This divergence is evident in non-neutral genetic variation also and it is usually explained to stem from founder effects occurring in the settlement of eastern Finland as late as in the 16th century. Here, we have reassessed this population historical scenario using Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial and autosomal markers and geographical sampling covering entire Finland. The obtained results suggest substantial Scandinavian gene flow into south-western, but not into the eastern, Finland. Male-biased Scandinavian gene flow into the south-western parts of the country would plausibly explain the large inter-regional differences observed in the Y-chromosome, and the relative homogeneity in the mitochondrial and autosomal data. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the expression of 'Finnish Disease Heritage' illnesses, more common in the eastern/north-eastern Finland, stems from long-term drift, rather than from relatively recent founder effects.},

Our understanding of the 20th-century epidemic of coronary artery disease (CAD), which dominates cardiology, has nevertheless been frustrated by problems of nosology. One of the purposes of this article is to discuss how our understanding of the epidemic has depended on classification of disease events and on the methods used to detect them.

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone is well known for its profound direct effects on cardiovascular function and metabolism. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the hormone also regulates these systems indirectly through the central nervous system. While some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the hormone's central control of metabolism have been identified, its actions in the central cardiovascular control have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe a previously unknown population of parvalbuminergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamus that requires thyroid hormone receptor signaling for proper development. Specific stereotaxic ablation of these cells in the mouse resulted in hypertension and temperature-dependent tachycardia, indicating a role in the central autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate. Moreover, the neurons exhibited intrinsic temperature sensitivity in patch-clamping experiments, providing a new connection between cardiovascular function and core temperature. Thus, the data identify what we believe to be a novel hypothalamic cell population potentially important for understanding hypertension and indicate developmental hypothyroidism as an epigenetic risk factor for cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, the findings may be beneficial for treatment of the recently identified patients that have a mutation in thyroid hormone receptor alpha1.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is still one of the most mysterious and costliest mental disorders in terms of human suffering and societal expenditure. Here, we focus on the key developments in biology, epidemiology, and pharmacology of schizophrenia and provide a syndromal framework in which these aspects can be understood together. Symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence of the disorder varies greatly across places and migrant groups, as do symptoms, course, and treatment response across individuals. Genetic vulnerability is shared in part with bipolar disorder and recent molecular genetic findings also indicate an overlap with developmental disorders such as autism. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission, the latter being directly related to hallucinations and delusions. Pharmacological treatments, which block the dopamine system, are effective for delusions and hallucinations but less so for disabling cognitive and motivational impairments. Specific vocational and psychological interventions, in combination with antipsychotic medication in a context of community-case management, can improve functional outcome but are not widely available. 100 years after being so named, research is beginning to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of schizophrenia and the psychosocial factors that moderate their expression. Although current treatments provide control rather than cure, long-term hospitalisation is not required and prognosis is better than traditionally assumed.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and influence of previously unknown overt or subclinical thyroid dysfunction in patients with acute ischemic stroke and to look for differences between cardio-embolic and non-embolic ischemic stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 153 Swedish patients diagnosed with first-time acute ischemic stroke were included in the study and categorized for suspected cardio-embolic (n = 30) or non-embolic (n = 123) ischemic stroke depending on the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Blood samples were taken 48 h or earlier after onset of stroke symptoms. RESULTS: Previously, unknown overt or subclinical thyroid dysfunction was found in 12\%. Previously, unknown overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism was more common in the AF group (13\%) compared to the non-AF group (3\%), P = 0.048. Patients with AF had slightly higher concentrations of free T4 (15 vs 14 pm; P {\textless} 0.001), but there was no significant difference in concentrations of S-TSH or prevalence of thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies between the groups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent randomized controlled trial suggests that hypothyroid subjects may find levothyroxine (l-T4) and levotriiodothyronine combination therapy to be superior to l-T4 monotherapy in terms of quality of life, suggesting that the brain registered increased T3 availability during the combination therapy. HYPOTHESIS: Peripheral tissue might also be stimulated during T4/T3 combination therapy compared with T4 monotherapy. METHODS: Serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), pro-collagen-1-N-terminal peptide (PINP), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (representing hepatocyte, osteoblast, and cardiomyocyte stimulation respectively) were measured in 26 hypothyroid subjects in a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial, which compared the replacement therapy with T4/T3 in combination (50 mug T4 was substituted with 20 mug T3) to T4 alone (once daily regimens). This was performed to obtain unaltered serum TSH levels during the trial and between the two treatment groups. Blood sampling was performed 24 h after the last intake of thyroid hormone medication. RESULTS: TSH remained unaltered between the groups ((median) 0.83 vs 1.18 mU/l in T4/T3 combination and T4 monotherapy respectively; P=0.534). SHBG increased from (median) 75 nmol/l at baseline to 83 nmol/l in the T4/T3 group (P=0.015) but remained unaltered in the T4 group (67 nmol/l); thus, it was higher in the T4/T3 vs T4 group (P=0.041). PINP levels were higher in the T4/T3 therapy (48 vs 40 mug/l (P{\textless}0.001)). NT-proBNP did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: T4/T3 combination therapy in hypothyroidism seems to have more metabolic effects than the T4 monotherapy.},

METHODS: The study population consisted of 100 individuals who were recently diagnosed for hypothyroidism. These patients had never been treated before with antihypertensive treatment or received drugs for hypothyroidism. All participants underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The control group consisted of 100 healthy volunteers matched one to one for gender and age with the hypothyroid participants. RESULTS: Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in patients with hypothyroidism compared with volunteers. The mean 24-h systolic blood pressure and 24-h pulse pressure were significantly higher in patients with hypothyroidism compared with volunteers. The 24-h systolic blood pressure variability was also significantly higher in patients with hypothyroidism. Fasting serum cholesterol tended to be higher in patients with hypothyroidism compared with volunteers but the difference was not statistically significant, while fasting serum triglycerides were significantly higher. Body mass index was also significantly higher in patients with hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that hypothyroidism may be an important predictor of higher mean 24-h systolic blood pressure, 24-h pulse pressure and 24-h systolic blood pressure variability, parameters of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring that have been previously associated with higher cardiovascular target organ damage.},

We have compared the performance of dichromats and normal observers in a task in which texture is camouflaged by colour. The texture elements in a target area differed in either orientation or size from the background elements. In one condition, the texture elements were all of the same colour; in the camouflage condition they were randomly coloured red or green. For trichromats, it proved to be more difficult to detect the target region in the camouflage condition, even though colour was completely irrelevant to the task. Dichromats (n = 7) did not show this effect, and indeed performed better than trichromats in the camouflage condition. We conclude that colour can interfere with segregation based upon texture, and that dichromats are less susceptible to such interference.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) alters the phenotype, insulin resistance, or lipid parameters in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care setting. PATIENT(S): Sixty-two young women with PCOS and SCH (group I) and 291 euthyroid women with PCOS (group II). INTERVENTION(S): Recording of clinical, biochemical, hormonal profile, and parameters of insulin resistance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Whether SCH has any association with clinical parameters like hirsutism, menstrual disturbances, lipid profile, and parameters of insulin sensitivity. RESULT(S): Mean (±SD) TSH was 7.13±1.28 IU/L in group I and 2.51±1.21 IU/L in group II, with comparable free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine. The two groups were comparable in age, weight, and body mass index. Parameters like blood pressure, menstrual pattern, and degree and duration of hirsutism did not differ between the two groups. Serum concentrations of triglycerides were significantly higher in the SCH group compared with controls. Plasma glucose concentrations both in fasting and after oral glucose tolerance test were similar between the two groups. Fasting insulin and other parameters of insulin resistance were not altered by SCH. CONCLUSION(S): Mild TSH elevation in the face of normal serum free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine results in a mild increase in serum lipids. Subclinical hypothyroidism is not associated with alteration in phenotypic expression and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS.},

	abstract = {Low triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in the presence of normal thyroxine (T4) and TSH levels, referred to as the low T3 syndrome (LT3S), are common. LT3S may be caused by starvation, various non-thyroidal illnesses (NTIs) and some medications. Reverse T3 (rT3) concentrations are elevated in the more severely ill, and they characteristically fail to respond to exogenous levothyroxine (l-T4) therapy. The biochemical abnormalities have been explained on the basis of altered peripheral deiodinase activities. Herein, we report on two patients with hypothyroid symptoms who on testing were found to have LT3S. They were atypical clinically in not having LT3S due to any of the usual causes, had no increased rT3 concentrations, and had a normal negative TSH feedback response to l-T4. One (patient 1) had previously been diagnosed with Hashimoto's autoimmune primary hypothyroidism and was on l-T4 therapy. Both had T4 concentrations in the reference range. TSH levels were elevated in patient 1 and in the reference range in patient 2. Starting or increasing l-T4 doses resulted in no clinical improvement and no increase in T3 levels in spite of a marked increase in T4 levels. It is suggested that in the absence of the usual causes, lack of elevated rT3 levels, response to treatment and intact negative TSH feedback these two patients differ from the usual secondary causes of decreases in deiodinase activity. It is speculated that they may represent primary alterations in deiodinase enzymes possibly due to genetic variations in the deiodinase-encoding genes. LEARNING POINTS: LT3S is commonly found secondary to starvation, NTIs and use of some medications.Low T3 levels are the result of alterations in the activity of deiodinase enzymes.LT3S without the usual causes may represent a primary disturbance in deiodinase activity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the status of iodine nutrition influences the TSH concentration in a selected Chinese reference population according to the criteria proposed by National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) and regular thyroid ultrasonography, to establish a new reference interval of TSH based on the wide variation of iodine nutrition in populations, and to identify an optimal interval of TSH by following up the cohort with normal TSH concentrations at baseline. DESIGN: The study was conducted in Panshan, Zhangwu and Huanghua, the regions with mildly deficient, more than adequate and excessive iodine intake, respectively. Of the 3761 unselected subjects who were enrolled at baseline, 2237 met the criteria for a reference population. Of 3048 subjects with normal serum TSH at baseline, 2727 (80.0\%) participated in the 5-year follow-up study. TSH and thyroid autoantibodies in serum and iodine in urine were measured, and B-mode ultrasonography of the thyroid was performed. RESULTS: In the reference population, there was a urinary iodine-related increment of serum TSH levels (r = 0.21, P = 0.000), and the mean levels of TSH in Panshan, Zhangwu and Huanghua were 1.15, 1.28 and 1.93 mIU/l, respectively (P = 0.000), corresponding to the rising regional iodine intake. Based on the overall data, we obtained a reference interval of 0.3-4.8 mIU/l. TSH concentrations obtained in the follow-up study correlated well with those at baseline (r = 0.58, P = 0.000). A baseline serum TSH {\textgreater} 1.9 mIU/l was associated with an increased incidence of development of supranormal TSH and a baseline serum TSH {\textless} 1.0 mIU/l was associated with an increased incidence of subnormal TSH development. CONCLUSIONS: Iodine nutrition is an important factor associated with TSH concentration even in the rigorously selected reference population. Baseline TSH of 1.0-1.9 mIU/l is an optimal interval with the lowest incidence of abnormal TSH in 5 years.},

Whether thyroid status affects the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality remains controversial. DESIGN The EPIC-Norfolk prospective population study. Mean follow-up was 10.6 years. PATIENTS Study participants were 11 554 men and women aged 45-79 years, who were living in Norfolk, UK. MEASUREMENTS Baseline cardiovascular risk factors were recorded and concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were measured in baseline samples. Regression analyses were performed to assess the association between thyroid hormone levels and cardiovascular risk factors. A proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of CHD and all-cause mortality by baseline thyroid status. No information was available on thyroid treatment during follow-up. RESULTS Thyroid abnormalities were common, particularly among women. Thyroid abnormalities were associated with an altered cardiovascular risk profile. Even within the normal range, thyroid hormone levels, TSH more strongly than FT4, were associated with lipid levels and blood pressure among both men and women. We did not observe a significant association between subclinical thyroid abnormalities and risk of CHD or all-cause mortality.

It is well known that thyroid disease may aggravate or induce heart disease, but the pathophysiological role of TSH and TSHRab is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate if TSHR is present in cardiac muscle. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions revealed TSHR in human heart and Northern blot on extracted RNA showed a RNA species of 4.4 kb. TSH stimulation of cultured mouse AT-1 cardiomyocytes elevated the levels of intracellular second messenger 3',5'-cyclic AMP. This effect of TSH could be inhibited by TSHR antibodies.

In a prospective study, we aimed to determine whether differences in TSH levels within the reference range are associated with future levels of blood pressure and lipids. DESIGN We conducted a prospective population-based study. METHODS In 9709 women and 4644 men without previous thyroid disease who had a baseline TSH level of 0.45-4.5 mU/l, we studied the associations of baseline TSH levels with blood pressure and lipid levels at follow-up 11 years later. RESULTS Higher TSH levels at baseline were associated with higher systolic (P=0.002 in women) and diastolic (P=0.03 in women) blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol (P=0.01 in men) and triglyceride (P=0.008 in men) levels and lower HDL cholesterol levels (P{\textless}0.001 in women and men) at follow-up, but the associations were very modest and not consistent between the sexes. Among people who remained free of thyroid disease, changes in TSH levels during follow-up were associated with concomitant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels (all P{\textless}0.001), with similar results being observed for women and men. Thus, blood pressure and lipid levels increased among people with an increase in TSH levels and decreased among people with a decrease in TSH levels compared with people with no change in TSH levels. CONCLUSIONS High TSH levels within the reference range may be associated with modestly higher future levels of blood pressure and adverse serum lipids. TSH levels may co-vary with blood pressure and lipid levels among people with apparently normal thyroid function.},

	abstract = {Context: TSH reference limits, particularly the upper limit, are controversial. The traditional and prevailing method for setting limits uses TSH distribution of thyroid disease-free individuals. The curve is not Gaussian, but skewed to higher concentrations, even after log-transformation; values in the skewed area are assumed to reflect mild hypothyroidism. The underlying assumption for this traditional approach, which has not previously been tested, is that the limits derived from this curve are applicable to all people. However, recent studies suggest that distinct subpopulations have unique TSH distribution and reference limits that are significantly different from limits established by the traditional approach. Evidence Acquisition: A search was focused on articles that provide the basis for current recommendations for setting TSH reference limits as well as articles that suggest that the traditional method does not reflect accurately the TSH distribution and reference limits of distinct subpopulations within the United States. Evidence Synthesis: TSH distribution and reference limits shift to higher concentrations with age, even up to centenarians, and are unique for different racial/ethnic groups, being at higher concentrations in Caucasians than either Blacks or Hispanics originating from Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. The distribution curve derived by the traditional approach represents a composite of curves from specific subpopulations that do not provide appropriate reference limits for those unique groups. Conclusions: Age- and race-specific TSH distribution and reference limits, possibly influenced by genetic factors, should be employed to provide clinicians accurate limits for specific populations and guidance for further evaluation of thyroid dysfunction.},

DESIGN: Prospective study of lipid concentrations in patients identified as having abnormal TSH. PATIENTS: Patients were identified in a population screening study of those over 60 years, with persistently low TSH with normal free T4 (n = 27) or high TSH but normal free T4 (n = 57). Patients were matched to controls with normal serum TSH by age, sex and body mass index. MEASUREMENTS: Serum TSH, free T4, free T3, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. RESULTS: Serum free T4 measurements were significantly higher in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism than in their controls (P {\textless} 0.001) and lower in those with subclinical hypothyroidism than in matched controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Measurement of fasting lipids in patients and controls revealed a marked (12.2\%) reduction in serum total cholesterol in subclinical hyperthyroidism (P {\textless} 0.01); no significant difference in fasting lipids between patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and controls was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in free T4 between those with low or high TSH and controls with normal TSH suggest that abnormalities of TSH directly reflect thyroid hormone excess and deficiency.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of hypolactasia and lactose intolerance in three different ethnic populations living in similar environmental conditions in Malaysia. The correlation between different symptoms and lactose intolerance test was also studied. METHODS: A total of 300 Malaysian subjects from three different ethnic populations: Malays, Chinese and Indians (100 volunteers in each group, 18-49 yr old working or studying in a University) were included. Urine galactose excretion and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured after lactose intake (50 g). RESULTS: Based on galactose excretion, 88 per cent of the Malays, 91 per cent of the Chinese and 83 per cent of the Indians were hypolactasic. The differences were statistically not significant. When the symptoms were also considered, prevalence of lactose intolerance appeared to be significantly lowest among the Indians. When the subjects were divided into low, middle and high galactose excretion groups some correlation was found between the symptoms and galactose excretion. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSION: There was no clear association between hypolactasia and gastrointestinal symptoms in all the study groups. However, the lactose intolerance was high in all the study groups indicating the increasing demand for low lactose dairy products in the Asian countries.},

	abstract = {Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), defined by elevated serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal levels of free thyroid hormones, is common in adults, especially in women over 60 years of age. Among individuals with this condition, up to two-thirds have serum TSH levels between 5-10 mU/L and thyroid autoantibodies; almost half of them may progress to overt thyroid failure, the annual percent risk increasing with serum TSH level. There is evidence that elevated TSH levels in patients with SH do not reflect pituitary compensation to maintain euthyroidism, but a mild tissue hypothyroidism sensu strictu. When lasting more than 6-12 months, SH may be associated with an atherogenic lipid profile, a hypercoagulable state, a subtle cardiac defect with mainly diastolic dysfunction, impaired vascular function, and reduced submaximal exercise capacity. The deviation from normality usually increases with serum TSH level ('dosage effect' phenomenon). Restoration of euthyroidism by levothyroxine (LT4) treatment may correct the lipid profile and cardiac abnormalities, especially in patients with an initially higher deviation from normality and higher serum TSH levels. Importantly, a strong association between SH and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, independent of the traditional risk factors, has been recently reported in a large cross-sectional survey (the Rotterdam Study). However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy. Therefore, until randomized, controlled, prospective, and adequately powered trials provide unequivocal answers to these critical questions, it is advisable to prescribe LT4 therapy on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk of progressive thyroid failure and the risk of cardiovascular events.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Higher serum TSH levels, both within the reference range and in those with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), have been associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular (CV) events in a number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate blood thrombogenicity in patients post-non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in relation to their thyroid function. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND OUTCOME MEASURE: At 1 week after troponin-positive NSTE-ACS, 70 patients who had been treated with optimal antiplatelet and secondary prevention therapy were studied. Patients with known thyroid disease or on medications affecting thyroid function were excluded. Blood thrombogenicity was assessed using the ex vivo Badimon perfusion chamber. RESULTS: Serum TSH was associated with higher thrombus burden (beta = .30; P = .01) independent of other well-established CV risk factors. Patients with SCH (n = 12; 17\%) had a higher thrombus burden than euthyroid individuals as evidenced by the area of the thrombus: mean (SD) 23 608 (10 498) vs 16 661 (10 902) mum(2)/mm (P = .02). However, this association was not evident when the analysis was limited to patients with serum TSH within the reference range. In addition, neither serum free T4 nor free T3 had any significant association with thrombus area. CONCLUSION: Serum TSH levels, particularly in the SCH range, are associated with higher thrombus burden despite optimal recommended secondary prevention therapy after NSTE-ACS. This may explain the higher CV risk seen in SCH patients. Future trials to assess the effect of individualized antithrombotic as well as thyroid hormone replacement therapy to reduce atherothrombotic risk in this population are needed.},

Hypofibrinolysis might be a risk factor for thromboembolic disease in subclinical hypothyroidism (SH). We measured fibrinolytic activity in patients with SH before and after levothyroxine (LT(4)) treatment and compared it to those of controls. We prospectively included 35 patients with SH and 30 healthy controls. We treated patients with LT(4) until almost 6 months after the euthyroid state has been achieved. We measured fibrinogen, D-dimer, antithrombin III (ATIII), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, and factor VII. Clinical and anthropometric variables were recorded for both groups. We found increased levels of fibrinogen, PAI-1, and factor VII and decreased levels of ATIII activity in patients compared to control (p {\textless} 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.05). Decrease of tPA was not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). At the end of the LT(4) treatment, significant decreases were determined in PAI-1 and factor VII (p {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, our data suggest an important role of hypofibrinolytic and hypercoagulable state on the development of atherosclerosis in patients with SH and beneficial effects of LT(4 )treatment for decreasing the risk of atherosclerosis.},

Since both subclinical and overt hypothyroidism have been associated with atherosclerosis, a hypercoagulable state in addition might represent a risk factor for thromboembolic disease. We investigated various haemostatic variables in 42 women with subclinical hypothyroidism and compared them to 66 euthyroid controls. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, factor VII activity (FVII:C), factor VII antigen (FVII:Ag), factor VIII activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF), antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II, protein C, protein S, plasminogen, antiplasmin, plasminogen activator inhibitor and tissue plasminogen activator, as well as common lipid variables, were measured. Factor VII:C (P {\textless} 0.02) and the ratio FVII:C/FVII:Ag (P {\textless} 0.01) were significantly increased in subclinical hypothyroid patients compared to the control group. Both parameters remained higher in hypothyroid patients after exclusion of 18 women on oestrogen replacement therapy. No differences were found between the groups with respect to vWF or the other haemostatic and lipid variables tested. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly higher levels of FVII:C. The greater increase in FVII:C compared to that of FVII:Ag, as shown by the increase in their ratio, might reflect the presence of activated FVIIa. This might mean a hypercoagulable state, which could contribute to the increased prevalence of coronary heart disease reported in such patients. A hypercoagulable state might be another argument in favour of thyroxine replacement treatment in subclinical hypothyroidism, especially in patients with additional risk factors for vascular disease.},

Thyroid hormones are known to affect the heart and vasculature and, as a result, the impact of SCH on the cardiovascular (CV) system has recently become an important topic of research. Strong evidence points to a link between SCH and CV risk factors such as alterations in blood pressure, lipid levels, and atherosclerosis. Additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that SCH is associated with metabolic syndrome and heart failure. The present review proposes that SCH may be a potentially modifiable risk factor of CV disease and mortality. However, large-scale clinical trials with appropriate power investigating the risks and benefits of SCH treatment are required to determine whether these benefits can be achieved with levothyroxine therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that relatively low thyroid function within the clinical reference range is positively associated with risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), but the association with CHD mortality is not resolved. METHODS: In a Norwegian population-based cohort study, we prospectively studied the association between thyrotropin levels and fatal CHD in 17,311 women and 8002 men without known thyroid or cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus at baseline. RESULTS: During median follow-up of 8.3 years, 228 women and 182 men died of CHD. Of these, 192 women and 164 men had thyrotropin levels within the clinical reference range of 0.50 to 3.5 mIU/L. Overall, thyrotropin levels within the reference range were positively associated with CHD mortality (P for trend = .01); the trend was statistically significant in women (P for trend = .005) but not in men. Compared with women in the lower part of the reference range (thyrotropin level, 0.50-1.4 mIU/L), the hazard ratios for coronary death were 1.41 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.96) and 1.69 (95\% CI, 1.14-2.52) for women in the intermediate (thyrotropin level, 1.5-2.4 mIU/L) and higher (thyrotropin level, 2.5-3.5 mIU/L) categories, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Thyrotropin levels within the reference range were positively and linearly associated with CHD mortality in women. The results indicate that relatively low but clinically normal thyroid function may increase the risk of fatal CHD.},

DESIGN Population-based cross-sectional study. SETTING A district of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS Random sample of 1149 women (mean age +/- SD, 69.0 +/- 7.5 years) participating in the Rotterdam Study. MEASUREMENTS Data on thyroid status, aortic atherosclerosis, and history of myocardial infarction were obtained at baseline. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level ({\textgreater}4.0 mU/L) and a normal serum free thyroxine level (11 to 25 pmol/L [0.9 to 1.9 ng/dL]). In tests for antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, a serum level greater than 10 IU/mL was considered a positive result. RESULTS Subclinical hypothyroidism was present in 10.8\% of participants and was associated with a greater age-adjusted prevalence of aortic atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.7 [95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.6]) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.3 [CI, 1.3 to 4.0]). Additional adjustment for body mass index, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, blood pressure, and smoking status, as well as exclusion of women who took beta-blockers, did not affect these estimates. Associations were slightly stronger in women who had subclinical hypothyroidism and antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (odds ratio for aortic atherosclerosis, 1.9 [CI, 1.1 to 3.6]; odds ratio for myocardial infarction, 3.1 [CI, 1.5 to 6.3]). No association was found between thyroid autoimmunity itself and cardiovascular disease. The population attributable risk percentage for subclinical hypothyroidism associated with myocardial infarction was within the range of that for known major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Studies of naturally occurring PCSK9 gene variants that caused extreme plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) deviations and altered atherosclerosis risk unleashed a torrent of biological and pharmacological research. Rapid progress in understanding the physiological regulation of PCSK9 was soon translated into commercially available biological inhibitors of PCSK9 that reduced LDL-C levels and likely also cardiovascular outcomes. Here we review the swift evolution of PCSK9 from novel gene to drug target, to animal and human testing, and finally to outcome trials and clinical applications. In addition, we explore how the genetics-guided path to PCSK9 inhibitor development exemplifies a new paradigm in pharmacology.

The effect of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inhibiting PCSK9 on the risk of cardiovascular events or diabetes is unknown. METHODS We used genetic scores consisting of independently inherited variants in the genes encoding PCSK9 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR; the target of statins) as instruments to randomly assign 112,772 participants from 14 studies, with 14,120 cardiovascular events and 10,635 cases of diabetes, to groups according to the number of LDL cholesterol-lowering alleles that they had inherited. We compared the effects of lower LDL cholesterol levels that were mediated by variants in PCSK9, HMGCR, or both on the risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of diabetes. RESULTS Variants in PCSK9 and HMGCR were associated with nearly identical protective effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per decrease of 10 mg per deciliter (0.26 mmol per liter) in the LDL cholesterol level: odds ratio for cardiovascular events, 0.81 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.89) for PCSK9 and 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.72 to 0.90) for HMGCR. Variants in these two genes were also associated with very similar effects on the risk of diabetes: odds ratio for each 10 mg per deciliter decrease in LDL cholesterol, 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.04 to 1.19) for PCSK9 and 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.20) for HMGCR. The increased risk of diabetes was limited to persons with impaired fasting glucose levels for both scores and was lower in magnitude than the protective effect against cardiovascular events. When present together, PCSK9 and HMGCR variants had additive effects on the risk of both cardiovascular events and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS In this study, variants in PCSK9 had approximately the same effect as variants in HMGCR on the risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes per unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level. The effects of these variants were independent and additive. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.).},

Main Outcome Measures: Complete thyroid status at baseline; disability in daily life, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and mortality from age 85 years through 89 years. Results: Plasma levels of thyrotropin and free thyroxine were not associated with disability in daily life, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment at baseline or during follow-up. Increasing levels of thyrotropin were associated with a lower mortality rate that remained after adjustments were made for baseline disability and health status. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality per SD increase of 2.71 mIU/L of thyrotropin was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.94; P=.009). The HR for mortality per SD increase of 0.21 ng/dL (2.67 pmol/L) of free thyroxine increased 1.16-fold (95\% CI, 1.04-1.30; P=.009). Conclusions: In the general population of the oldest old, elderly individuals with abnormally high levels of thyrotropin do not experience adverse effects and may have a prolonged life span. However, evidence for not treating elderly individuals can only come from a well-designed, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low serum thyrotropin, in combination with normal concentrations of circulating thyroid hormones, is common, especially in elderly people and in individuals with a history of thyroid disease. We aimed to assess the long-term effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism on mortality. METHODS: We did a population-based study of mortality in a cohort of 1191 individuals not on thyroxine or antithyroid medication. All participants were aged 60 years or older. We measured concentration of thyrotropin in serum at baseline in 1988-89. We recorded vital status on June 1, 1999, and ascertained causes of death for those who had died. We compared data for causes of death with age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific data for England and Wales. We also compared mortality within the cohort according to initial thyrotropin measurement. RESULTS: During 9733 person-years of follow-up, 509 of 1191 people died, the expected number of deaths being 496 (standardised mortality ratio [SMR] 1.0, 95\% CI 0.9-1.1). Mortality from all causes was significantly increased at 2 (SMR 2.1), 3 (2.1), 4 (1.7), and 5 (1.8) years after first measurement in those with low serum thyrotropin (n471). These increases were largely accounted for by significant increases in mortality due to circulatory diseases (SMR 2.1, 2.2, 1.9, 2.0, at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Increases in mortality from all causes in years 2-5 were higher in patients with low serum thyrotropin than in the rest of the cohort (hazard ratios for years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.1, 2.2, 1.8, and 1.8, respectively). This result reflects an increase in mortality from circulatory diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.3, 2.6, 2.3, 2.3), and specifically from cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 3.3, 3.0, 2.3, 2.2). INTERPRETATION: A single measurement of low serum thyrotropin in individuals aged 60 years or older is associated with increased mortality from all causes, and in particular mortality due to circulatory and cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Myocardial and vascular endothelial tissues have receptors for thyroid hormones and are sensitive to changes in the concentrations of circulating thyroid hormones. The importance of thyroid hormones in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis can be deduced from clinical and experimental data showing that even subtle changes in thyroid hormone concentrations - such as those observed in subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and low triiodothyronine syndrome - adversely influence the cardiovascular system. Some potential mechanisms linking the two conditions are dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction, blood pressure changes, and direct effects of thyroid hormones on the myocardium. Several interventional trials showed that treatment of subclinical thyroid diseases improves cardiovascular risk factors, which implies potential benefits for reducing cardiovascular events. Over the past 2 decades, accumulating evidence supports the association between abnormal thyroid function at the time of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, experimental studies showed that thyroid hormones can have an important therapeutic role in reducing infarct size and improving myocardial function after acute MI. In this Review, we summarize the literature on thyroid function in cardiovascular diseases, both as a risk factor as well as in the setting of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure or acute MI, and outline the effect of thyroid hormone replacement therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND 
Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin– 
kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels 
by approximately 60\%. Whether it prevents cardiovascular events is uncertain. 
METHODS 
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 27,564 
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 
70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) or higher who were receiving statin therapy. 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive evolocumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks 
or 420 mg monthly) or matching placebo as subcutaneous injections. The primary 
efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key 
secondary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction, or stroke. The median duration of follow-up was 2.2 years. 
RESULTS 
At 48 weeks, the least-squares mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol levels 
with evolocumab, as compared with placebo, was 59\%, from a median baseline value 
of 92 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter) to 30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per liter) 
(P{\textless}0.001). Relative to placebo, evolocumab treatment significantly reduced the risk 
of the primary end point (1344 patients [9.8\%] vs. 1563 patients [11.3\%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.85; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.92; P{\textless}0.001) and the key secondary 
end point (816 [5.9\%] vs. 1013 [7.4\%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.88; 
P{\textless}0.001). The results were consistent across key subgroups, including the subgroup 
of patients in the lowest quartile for baseline LDL cholesterol levels (median, 
74 mg per deciliter [1.9 mmol per liter]). There was no significant difference between 
the study groups with regard to adverse events (including new-onset diabetes and 
neurocognitive events), with the exception of injection-site reactions, which were 
more common with evolocumab (2.1\% vs. 1.6\%). 
CONCLUSIONS 
In our trial, inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab on a background of statin therapy 
lowered LDL cholesterol levels to a median of 30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per 
liter) and reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. These findings show that patients 
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease benefit from lowering of LDL cholesterol 
levels below current targets. (Funded by Amgen; FOURIER ClinicalTrials.gov number,

	abstract = {CONTEXT The prevalence of abnormal thyroid function in the United States and the significance of thyroid dysfunction remain controversial. Systemic effects of abnormal thyroid function have not been fully delineated, particularly in cases of mild thyroid failure. Also, the relationship between traditional hypothyroid symptoms and biochemical thyroid function is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of abnormal thyroid function and the relationship between (1) abnormal thyroid function and lipid levels and (2) abnormal thyroid function and symptoms using modern and sensitive thyroid tests. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS Participants in a statewide health fair in Colorado, 1995 (N = 25 862). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) and total thyroxine (T4) concentrations, serum lipid levels, and responses to a hypothyroid symptoms questionnaire. RESULTS The prevalence of elevated TSH levels (normal range, 0.3-5.1 mIU/L) in this population was 9.5\%, and the prevalence of decreased TSH levels was 2.2\%. Forty percent of patients taking thyroid medications had abnormal TSH levels. Lipid levels increased in a graded fashion as thyroid function declined. Also, the mean total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of subjects with TSH values between 5.1 and 10 mIU/L were significantly greater than the corresponding mean lipid levels in euthyroid subjects. Symptoms were reported more often in hypothyroid vs euthyroid individuals, but individual symptom sensitivities were low. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of abnormal biochemical thyroid function reported here is substantial and confirms previous reports in smaller populations. Among patients taking thyroid medication, only 60\% were within the normal range of TSH. Modest elevations of TSH corresponded to changes in lipid levels that may affect cardiovascular health. Individual symptoms were not very sensitive, but patients who report multiple thyroid symptoms warrant serum thyroid testing. These results confirm that thyroid dysfunction is common, may often go undetected, and may be associated with adverse health outcomes that can be avoided by serum TSH measurement.},

	abstract = {High affinity uptake of serum-derived low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is accomplished through the LDL receptor in the liver. In mammals, thyroid hormone depletion leads to decreased LDL receptor expression and elevated serum cholesterol. The clinical association in humans has been known since the 1920s; however, a molecular explanation has been lacking. LDL receptor levels are subject to negative feedback regulation by cellular cholesterol through sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). Here we demonstrate that the SREBP-2 gene is regulated by thyroid hormone and that increased SREBP-2 nuclear protein levels in hypothyroid animals results in thyroid hormone-independent activation of LDL receptor gene expression and reversal of the associated hypercholesterolemia. This occurs without effects on other thyroid hormone-regulated genes. Thus, we propose that the decreased LDL receptor and increased serum cholesterol associated with hypothyroidism are secondary to the thyroid hormone effects on SREBP-2. These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia associated with hypothyroidism can be reversed by agents that directly increase SREBP-2. Additionally, these results indicate that mutations or drugs that lower nuclear SREBP-2 would cause hypercholesterolemia.},

Overnutrition and insulin resistance are the major causes of diabetic hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in humans. Studies in the past decade provide evidence that bile acids are not just biological detergents facilitating gut nutrient absorption, but also important metabolic regulators of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Pharmacological alteration of bile acid metabolism or bile acid signaling pathways such as using bile acid receptor agonists or bile acid binding resins may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. On the other hand, bile acid signaling is complex, and the molecular mechanisms mediating the bile acid effects are still not completely understood. This paper will summarize recent advances in our understanding of bile acid signaling in regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, and the potentials of developing novel therapeutic strategies that target bile acid metabolism for the treatment of metabolic disorders.},

	abstract = {Bile acids are physiological detergents that generate bile flow and facilitate intestinal absorption and transport of lipids, nutrients, and vitamins. Bile acids also are signaling molecules and inflammatory agents that rapidly activate nuclear receptors and cell signaling pathways that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids exerts important physiological functions not only in feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis but also in control of whole-body lipid homeostasis. In the liver, bile acids activate a nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that induces an atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner, which subsequently inhibits nuclear receptors, liver-related homolog-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and results in inhibiting transcription of the critical regulatory gene in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In the intestine, FXR induces an intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15; or FGF19 in human), which activates hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signaling to inhibit bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism by which FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 signaling inhibits CYP7A1 remains unknown. Bile acids are able to induce FGF19 in human hepatocytes, and the FGF19 autocrine pathway may exist in the human livers. Bile acids and bile acid receptors are therapeutic targets for development of drugs for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, fatty liver diseases, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Fatty liver is an important complication of obesity; however, regulatory mechanisms mediating altered gene expression patterns have not been identified. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify novel transcriptional changes in human liver that could contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation and associated insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. DESIGN: We evaluated gene expression in surgical liver biopsies from 13 obese (nine with type 2 diabetes) and five control subjects using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. PCR validation was performed in liver biopsies using an additional 16 subjects. We also tested thyroid hormone responses in mice fed chow or high-fat diet. SETTING: Recruitment was performed in an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals undergoing elective surgery for obesity or gallstones participated in the study. RESULTS: The top-ranking gene set, down-regulated in obese subjects, was comprised of genes previously demonstrated to be positively regulated by T(3) in human skeletal muscle (n = 399; P {\textless} 0.001; false discovery rate = 0.07). This gene set included genes related to RNA metabolism (SNRPE, HNRPH3, TIA1, and SFRS2), protein catabolism (PSMA1, PSMD12, USP9X, IBE2B, USP16, and PCMT1), and energy metabolism (ATP5C1, COX7C, UQCRB). We verified thyroid hormone regulation of these genes in the liver after injection of C57BL/6J mice with T(3) (100 microg/100 g body weight); furthermore, T(3)-induced increases in expression of these genes were abolished by high-fat diet. In agreement, expression of these genes inversely correlated with liver fat content in humans. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that impaired thyroid hormone action may contribute to altered patterns of gene expression in fatty liver.},

Elevated serum TSH levels in euthyroid subjects were recently reported to correlate with high values of serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). This protein, expressed and secreted by hepatocytes, promotes higher LDL-cholesterol levels. We tested whether an acute increase of TSH levels following administration of TSH in vivo would raise PCSK9 levels in patients who had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and radioablation for thyroid cancer.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nFINDINGS: TSH levels rose from 0.64 ± 1.02 mU/L on day 1 to 98.66 ± 4.83 mU/L on day 3, following injections of recombinant human TSH (on days 1 and 2). PCSK9 levels were 330 ± 99 ng/ml on day 1, and did not change on days 3 or 5 in response to TSH stimulation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Although a positive correlation between TSH and PCSK9 in euthyroid subjects has raised the possibility that TSH might act on the liver to raise PCSK9 values, our data show that PCSK9 levels are not affected by acute elevations of TSH levels.

Here, we investigated whether thyroid hormone (TH) actions involve other mechanisms that may also account for the reduction in LDL-cholesterol, including effects on proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and bile acid synthesis. Twenty hyperthyroid patients were studied before and after clinical normalization, and the responses to hyperthyroidism were compared with those in 14 healthy individuals after 14 days of treatment with the liver-selective TH analog eprotirome. Both hyperthyroidism and eprotirome treatment reduced circulating PCSK9, lipoprotein cholesterol, apoB and AI, and lipoprotein(a), while cholesterol synthesis was stable. Hyperthyroidism, but not eprotirome treatment, markedly increased bile acid synthesis and reduced fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 and dietary cholesterol absorption. Eprotirome treatment, but not hyperthyroidism, reduced plasma triglycerides. Neither hyperthyroidism nor eprotirome treatment altered insulin, glucose, or FGF21 levels. TH reduces circulating PSCK9, thereby likely contributing to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol in hyperthyroidism. TH also stimulates bile acid synthesis, although this response is not critical for its LDL-lowering effect.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common metabolic disorders associated with dyslipidemia which poses a higher risk of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in such patients. Biochemical markers which can pick up the risk promptly are becoming imperative now-a-days and thus the assessment beyond the conventional lipid profile is the need of the hour. Aims: To assess the association of non-conventional lipid parameters like small dense Low Density Lipoprotein (sd LDL), oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (ox LDL), Apolipoprotein A (Apo A1), Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and Lipoprotein (a) \{Lp(a)\} in hypothyroid patients and compare their values with the conventional lipid parameters such as Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty clinically proven patients of hypothyroidism aged 20-60 years and equal number of age and gender matched healthy individuals were included in this case control study. Serum sd LDL, ox LDL, Apo A1, Apo B, Lp (a), lipid profile, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) and Free Tetraiodothyronine (FT4) levels were measured in both the groups. The data was recorded and analysed on SPSS system. The results of cases and controls were compared by student t-test and one-way ANOVA. All the parameters were correlated with TSH by Pearson’s correlation. Results: We found significantly high levels of sd LDL, ox LDL, Apo B, Lp (a), TC, TG, LDL-C in cases as compared to the controls. Ox LDL has shown maximum correlation with serum TSH (p{\textless}0.0001, r=0.801) followed by sd LDL (p{\textless}0.0001, r=0.792), Apo B (p{\textless}0.001, r=0.783) and LDL-C (p{\textless}0.001, r=0.741). Moreover, ox LDL and sd LDL were found to be increased in normolipidemic hypothyroid patients thereby giving a strong supportive evidence that estimation of these parameters can become fundamental in prompt identification of the high risk patients of CAD in hypothyroid population. Conclusion: Non-conventional lipid parameters appear to be better markers for the assessment of cardiovascular risk in hypothyroidism and might help in the designing of the effective treatment protocols and areas of intervention by the clinicians as well as researchers.},

The condition is particularly prevalent in older women, in whom autoimmune thyroiditis is common.

Worldwide, dietary iodine deficiency remains an important cause. Hypothyroidism can present with nonspecific constitutional and neuropsychiatric complaints, or with hypercholesterolaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperprolactinaemia, or hyperhomocysteinaemia. Severe untreated hypothyroidism can lead to heart failure, psychosis, and coma. Although these manifestations are neither specific nor sensitive, the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded by measurements of serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine. Thyroxine replacement therapy is highly effective and safe, but suboptimal dosing is common in clinical practice. Patient noncompliance, drug interactions, and pregnancy can lead to inadequate treatment. Iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis can cause symptoms, and, even when mild, provoke atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVE The objective was to investigate the association between TSH and lipid profiles. DESIGN We used a population-based cross-sectional study design and analyzed our results using multivariable regression models. SETTING The study was conducted in Germany. PARTICIPANTS We analyzed data from 6622 children (ages 3-10 y) and 6134 adolescents (ages 11-17 y) drawn from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). INTERVENTION Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood samples were collected, and serum TSH levels were measured using the electrochemiluminescence method. High and low serum TSH levels were defined according to age-specific reference limits for the assay. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels were determined with enzymatic color analyses. RESULTS We found a significant positive association between TSH and all non-HDL parameters (total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides) in children (β = 0.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.27; β = 0.78, 95\% CI, 0.44-1.13; and β = 0.90, 95\% CI, 0.52-1.27, respectively) and in adolescents (β = 0.90, 95\% CI, 0.47-1.32; β = 0.67, 95\% CI, 0.29-1.05; and β = 0.92, 95\% CI, 0.49-1.35, respectively) (P {\textless} .05). Using stratified models, we found that this relationship was particularly present in overweight/obese children. Furthermore, high TSH levels in children were significantly associated with non-HDL parameters. CONCLUSIONS Higher TSH levels are associated with less favorable lipid levels in children. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether the association between TSH and lipid parameters in children and adolescents is a temporary phenomenon or is sustained into adulthood.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) is required for normal development as well as regulating metabolism in the adult. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, α and β, are differentially expressed in tissues and have distinct roles in TH signaling. Local activation of thyroxine (T4), to the active form, triiodothyronine (T3), by 5'-deiodinase type 2 (D2) is a key mechanism of TH regulation of metabolism. D2 is expressed in the hypothalamus, white fat, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle and is required for adaptive thermogenesis. The thyroid gland is regulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In addition to TRH/TSH regulation by TH feedback, there is central modulation by nutritional signals, such as leptin, as well as peptides regulating appetite. The nutrient status of the cell provides feedback on TH signaling pathways through epigentic modification of histones. Integration of TH signaling with the adrenergic nervous system occurs peripherally, in liver, white fat, and BAT, but also centrally, in the hypothalamus. TR regulates cholesterol and carbohydrate metabolism through direct actions on gene expression as well as cross-talk with other nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR), and bile acid signaling pathways. TH modulates hepatic insulin sensitivity, especially important for the suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The role of TH in regulating metabolic pathways has led to several new therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. Understanding the mechanisms and interactions of the various TH signaling pathways in metabolism will improve our likelihood of identifying effective and selective targets.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is estimated to be the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years lost worldwide being coronary heart disease the most prevalent form of heart disease. The underlying cause of most CVD is atherosclerosis, a process mainly governed by lifestyle factors. Several epidemiological studies have enabled the recognition of the major risk factors for CVD development,  the so-called conventional risk factors'. Identification of such global risk factors have led, in turn, to the development of risk-prediction algorithms and cardiovascular risk models for men and women. Indeed, during the last years, there has been increasing credit of the importance of CVD in women accompanied by growing awareness of gender differences in natural history, preventive strategies, treatment, and prognosis of CVD. Classical risk factors, however, cannot fully explain the excess cardiovascular risk, and at least 25\% of all future events occur in individuals with only one of the classical risk factors. This scenario has prompted the interest for discovering new risk factors. Time-trend analysis of surveys by the European Society of Cardiology (EUROASPIRE surveys) has reflected, however, that large proportions of European coronary patients are failing to achieve lifestyle, risk factor, and therapeutic targets for the prevention of CVD leaving room from improvement. Moreover, although overt CVD takes place during adulthood, lifestyle and dietary changes that have occurred over the last two decades support the need to instigate primary prevention measures during childhood as the best strategy to retard atherogenic processes.},

	abstract = {Background: The age-specific relevance of blood pressure to cause-specific mortality is best assessed by collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from the separate prospective studies. Methods: Information was obtained on each of one million adults with no previous vascular disease recorded at baseline in 61 prospective observational studies of blood pressure and mortality. During 12??7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56 000 vascular deaths (12 000 stroke, 34 000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 10 000 other vascular) and 66 000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years. Meta-analyses, involving "time-dependent" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade. Findings: Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP), below which there is little evidence. At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual SBP (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual DBP) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from IHD and from other vascular causes. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age. The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia. For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of SBP and DBP is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative. Interpretation: Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.},

Adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, BMI and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at baseline, multiple linear regression analyses found no relationship between serum TSH at baseline and levels of blood pressure at follow-up, but the changes in serum TSH levels during follow-up was positively associated with the changes in systolic blood pressure (B=2.134, P{\textless}0.05), which became more significant in women but not significant in men. The change of systolic blood pressure in group of TSH increase {\textgreater}0.5 mIU l -1 was significantly higher than in group of TSH decrease {\textgreater}0.5 mIU l -1 within reference, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, BMI and HOMA-IR at baseline.

METHODS: Data from 4298 individuals, 20-79 years of age were available for the present analysis. Thyroid function (thyrotropin [TSH], free triiodothyronine [FT(3)], and free thyroxine [FT(4)]) and serum autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase (anti-TPOAb) were evaluated from blood samples. Thyroid structure and size were measured by ultrasound. RESULTS: A reference population was selected comprising 1488 persons (825 men) by excluding subjects with known thyroid diseases, and with yet unknown thyroid disorders such as goitre, inhomogeneous thyroid pattern, nodules, hypoechogenicity and anti-TPOAb seropositivity. Reference intervals for serum TSH, FT(3), and FT(4) were 0.25-2.12 mIU/L, 3.8-7.0 pmol/L, and 8.3-18.9 pmol/L, respectively. Reference serum TSH levels were not comparable to the reference values that were recently established for the U.S. population and most reference values slightly differed from the reference values provided by the manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: The reference ranges of thyroid function tests in this formerly iodine-deficient region are distinct from the reference ranges that were established in areas with iodine sufficiency. Creating a reference population in the present setting should include thyroid ultrasound in order to exclude yet undiagnosed thyroid disorders.},

This study reviews the functional performance of the TSH immunometric assay methods currently used in clinical practice. Methodological differences between methods, the rationale for using the 20\% interassay CV as the functional sensitivity limit for patient reports, and both TSH-related and non-TSH-related specificity problems are reviewed. We recommend that manufacturers and clinical laboratories use a clinically relevant standard protocol for functional sensitivity assessments. In this protocol, human serum pools are analyzed in random order 10 or more times across a clinically realistic time span (which approximates to 6-8 weeks for TSH measurements used in an outpatient setting). Laboratories should independently establish and periodically check their functional sensitivity by the standard protocol and enlist the manufacturer's help to accomplish this if necessary. Manufacturers should (a) develop promotional material that realistically projects the assay's functional sensitivity expected in a clinical laboratory setting, (b) ensure that new clinical laboratory users achieve the projected functional sensitivity target when using the standard protocol, and (c) focus on the typical functional sensitivity obtained by clinical laboratory users rather than the assay's "generation" achieved under ideal conditions. If manufacturers and laboratories collaborate to solve the sensitivity and specificity problems discussed here, clinical laboratories should be better able to consistently deliver reliable serum TSH measurements across the full range of TSH concentrations encountered in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Although numerous reports have discussed the upper limit of the thyrotropin (TSH) reference interval, none have dealt with the lower limit. Recent recommendations regarding subclinical thyroid dysfunction give different advice about its management, depending on whether the TSH concentration is {\textless}0.1 mIU/L or 0.1-0.4 mIU/L. CONTENT We review key studies that have investigated the links between low TSH concentrations, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality, with a focus on the TSH measurement threshold and assay type. SUMMARY Despite numerous consensus guidelines and publications of expert opinion, the management of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains largely intuitive and "nonevidence-based." The primary reason for this unsatisfactory situation is the absence of clinical-intervention trials. Important aspects that remain to be addressed are the influence of the method used to measure TSH, the definition of "normality," and the lack of evidence to base the grading of cardiovascular risk on the degree of TSH suppression. A risk-based approach should be adopted to determine the thresholds that would justify interventions. Such considerations assume, of course, that proof will emerge from ongoing clinical trials to support the medical utility of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism.},

Based on the blood levels of thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 308 patients were considered euthyroid and 169 were hypothyroid [T4 = 2.9 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl and TSH = 105.8 +/- 6.8 microU/ml (mean +/- SEM)]. Diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure in hypothyroid patients over 50 years was higher than in euthyroid patients of corresponding age groups. The prevalence of hypertension was higher in hypothyroid patients when hypertension was defined as the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure above 160/95 mm Hg (14.8\% vs 5.5\%; p less than 0.01). Correlations between diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure and either the blood level of triiodothyronine (T3) or T4 was significant (r = - 0.174, p less than 0.01, and r = 0.208, p less than 0.01, respectively) when data from both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients were combined. Adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy for an average 14.8 months in 14 patients resulted in a normalization of thyroid function and a reduction of blood pressure (p less than 0.01). In four who showed no change in thyroid function due to inadequate replacement therapy, blood pressure remained elevated. These results suggest a close association between hypertension and hypothyroidism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of our present study was to establish new reference intervals for thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormones based on National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) criteria and regular thyroid ultrasonography. We also assessed the effect of potentially confounding factors to modulate the limits of these intervals. METHODS: We investigated 870 apparently healthy persons and excluded, step by step, those with a family history of thyroid disease, pathologic thyroid ultrasonography results, and increased anti-thyroid peroxidase or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Accordingly, only 453 of the 870 persons in the entire group were finally included as reference collective. We measured serum concentrations of TSH, total and free thyroxine (T(4) and FT(4)), and total and free triiodothyronine (T(3) and FT(3)) of the whole and the reference collective on the ELECSYS system assays (Roche Diagnostics) and calculated the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for comparison. RESULTS: The calculated lower limit for TSH differed significantly between the reference intervals for healthy persons with an assessed normal thyroid gland vs the nonselected group of healthy blood donors. Age was the only independent factor and was significantly inversely associated with TSH (P {\textless}0.0001). Use of oral contraceptives was a significant predictor for variation in T(4) concentrations (P {\textless}0.001). Age and oral contraceptives were independently associated with T(3) variations (P {\textless}0.05). For FT(4) vs FT(3) variation, gender and (inversely) age (P {\textless}0.01) were independent modulating factors. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of healthy persons according to NACB criteria combined with sonographic confirmation of a normal thyroid gland provide a valid basis for the reference interval for TSH. Factors indicating a preclinical disease state, such as family history, pathologic ultrasonography result, or increased anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, can be associated with normal hormone concentrations. Additionally, patient age and gender as well as use of contraceptives should be considered in diagnostic evaluation of thyroid diseases.},

	abstract = {Hypothyroidism has been known to be associated, at times, with diastolic hypertension. We have found in 40 thyrotoxic patients that the induction of hypothyroidism by radioiodine therapy significantly increased diastolic blood pressure, raising it above 90 mm Hg in 16 (40\%) of the patients. Restoration of euthyroidism with thyroxine administration significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in these patients, with a fall in diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg in nine of 16 patients. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was determined by measurements of serum thyroxine and thyrotropin concentrations in 688 consecutive hypertensive patients, referred for evaluation and therapy of their hypertension. Hypothyroidism was found in 25 (3.6\%) of the patients. Restoration of normal serum thyroxine and thyrotropin levels with thyroid hormone replacement therapy lowered diastolic blood pressure to levels below 90 mm Hg in 32\% of these patients who could be followed up after withdrawal of all antihypertensive drug therapy when euthyroidism had been restored (i.e., 1.2\% of the 688 patients).

The study aimed to explore the relationship between different levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and blood pressure in the participants with subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroidism. A total of 1319 participants were administered a questionnaire survey, and their blood pressure, height and body weight measurements were taken. Blood samples were taken to test serum TSH. FT3 and FT4 were further examined if TSH was abnormal. Participants were divided into euthyroid group and subclinical hypothyroidism group. Euthyroid group was further divided into three groups: group A (TSH 0.3-0.99 mIU l(-1)), group B (TSH 1.0-1.9 mIU l(-1)) and group C (TSH 1.91-4.8 mIU l(-1)). Results showed that different levels of serum TSH had no relation with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The prevalence of hypertension in subclinical hypothyroidism group was significantly higher than euthyroid group in females (41.3 vs 25.6\%, P{\textless}0.05). The risk of hypertension in subclinical hypothyroidism group was significantly higher than that in the euthyroid group after adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, HOMA-IR (homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and body mass index (odds ratio (OR)=1.753, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.067-2.879, P=0.027). This association was stronger in females (OR=3.545, 95\% CI 1.576-7.975, P=0.004), but there was no statistical significance in males. Within normal range of TSH, both SBP and DBP were similar among the three groups. The prevalence and risk of hypertension were also similar among the three groups. In conclusion, the prevalence of hypertension in subclinical hypothyroidism group was significantly higher than in euthyroid group in females.

METHODS: The Study of Health in Pomerania is a population-based survey in Germany that was conducted in a previously iodine-deficient region. A study population of 4087 subjects (2050 women) without overt hyperthyroidism or increased serum thyrotropin levels was available for the present study. Serum thyrotropin levels {\textless} 0.25 mIU/l and {\textless} 0.1 mIU/l were considered decreased and suppressed, respectively. RESULTS: Multivariable analyses revealed lower adjusted mean values for systolic blood pressure in subjects with decreased [132.9 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 131.1 mmHg; 134.8 mmHg] versus normal serum thyrotropin levels (135.0 mmHg, 95\% CI = 134.4 mmHg; 135.6 mmHg, P = 0.04). The adjusted mean values for diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure did not differ significantly between both groups. Analyses that were performed after all subjects receiving antihypertensive medications had been excluded did not reveal any statistically significant associations between decreased serum thyrotropin levels and the endpoints investigated. There was also no association of suppressed serum thyrotropin levels with blood pressure or hypertension. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that subclinical hyperthyroidism, as demonstrated by decreased as well as suppressed serum thyrotropin levels and serum free thyroid hormone levels within the reference range, is not associated with hypertension.},

The TSH median, 97.5 centile and prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), normal serum T(4) and TSH greater than 4.5 mIU/liter, increased progressively with age. Age-adjusted reference ranges would include many people with TSH greater than 4.5 mIU/liter. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether increasing 50 and 97.5 centiles with age resulted from more patients with SCH in populations with normal TSH distribution or whether age-specific population shifts to higher serum TSH might account for these findings. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: We analyzed TSH, antithyroid antibodies, and TSH frequency distribution curves for specific age deciles in populations without thyroid disease, with or without antithyroid antibodies. RESULTS: Without thyroid disease, 10.6\% of 20- to 29-yr-olds had TSH greater than 2.5 mIU/liter, increasing to 40\% in the 80+ group, 14.5\% of whom had TSH greater than 4.5 mIU/liter. When TSH was greater than 4.5 mIU/liter, the percentage with antibodies was 67.4\% (age 40-49 yr) and progressively decreased to 40.5\% in the 80+ group. TSH frequency distribution curves of the 80+ group with or without antibodies was displaced to higher TSH, including TSH at peak frequency. The 97.5 centiles for the 20-29 and 80+ groups were 3.56 and 7.49 mIU/liter, respectively. Seventy percent of older patients with TSH greater than 4.5 mIU/liter were within their age-specific reference range. CONCLUSION: TSH distribution progressively shifts toward higher concentrations with age. The prevalence of SCH may be significantly overestimated unless an age-specific range for TSH is used.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analysed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods and each method with natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentile were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below and above the limits for each method. RESULTS The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffman method 43\% = 3·1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffman method (708\% = 0·81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below or above the normal range for all methods. CONCLUSIONS Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off level and clinical decision-making cannot rely on these calculated limits.},

	abstract = {The thyroid hormones (THs, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)) have important effects on development, growth, and metabolism (1-3). Some of the most prominent effects of TH occur during fetal development and early childhood. In humans, the early developmental role of TH is illustrated by the distinctive clinical features of cretinism observed in iodine-deficient areas. In childhood, lack of TH can cause delayed growth. However, in this latter case, many of the effects of TH may be metabolic rather than developmental, as growth is restored rapidly after the institution of TH treatment. In adults, the primary effects of THs are manifested by alterations in metabolism. These effects include changes in oxygen consumption, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and vitamin metabolism. The clinical features of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism emphasize the pleiotropic effects of these hormones on many different pathways and target organs. At the clinical level, identification of quantitative markers of TH action has been difficult (4). At the extreme ends of the clinical spectrum, which extends from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of a thyroid abnormality is usually apparent. Clinical suspicion of a thyroid abnormality can be confirmed using laboratory tests for THs and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). However, more subtle forms of thyroid dysfunction, such as subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, pose a greater challenge. Although the level of circulating TSH provides a sensitive and quantitative indicator of TH action at the level of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, there are few reliable peripheral or intracellular markers of TH action (5,6). The effect of TH on basal metabolism has been re-evaluated using measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE). In hypothyroid patients taking varying levels of TH replacement, there is a strong inverse correlation between REE and the TSH level (6). Nevertheless, TSH remains the most sensitive and useful clinical indicator of TH action. As discussed below, tissue-selective metabolism of THs, and variable tissue sensitivity to their effects, underscores the need to develop additional markers of TH activity in peripheral tissues. Since the initial description of TH effects on metabolic rate more than 100 years ago (7), many theories have been proposed to explain its mechanism of hormone action. The proposed models include: uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, stimulation of energy expenditure by the activation of Na+-K+ ATPase activity, and direct modulation of TH transporters and enzymes in the plasma membrane and mitochondria (8). Recently, there has been increasing evidence for non-genomic actions (see later under non-genomic actions of TH) (8); however, the major effects of TH occur via nuclear receptors that mediate changes in gene expression.},

The indication for screening is particularly compelling in women, but it can also be justified in men as a relatively cost-effective measure in the context of the periodic health examination.

	abstract = {Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone are by definition independent of nuclear receptors for the hormone and have been described at the plasma membrane, various cell organelles, the cytoskeleton, and in cytoplasm. The actions include alterations in solute transport (Ca2+, Na+, glucose), changes in activities of several kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), effects on efficiency of specific mRNA translation and mRNA t1/2, modulation of mitochondrial respiration, and regulation of actin polymerization (promotion of formation of F-actin). Iodothyronines also can regulate nongenomically the state of contractile elements in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The physiologic significance at the cellular level of certain of these actions has been demonstrated, for example, in the cases of myocardiocyte Na+ current, red cell Ca2+ content, and the control by hormone-induced alterations in actin solubility of cell surface activity of iodothyronine 5'-monodeiodinase activity and the intracellular distribution of protein disulfide isomerase activity. The physiologic significance of these actions at the organ or system level is less clear, but extranuclear effects of thyroid hormone on myocardial Na+ channel, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, and contractile state of VSMC may each contribute to acute effects of thyroid hormone on cardiac output that have recently been described clinically. The molecular mechanisms for nongenomic actions are incompletely understood; relevant binding sites and signal transduction pathways have been described for hormone actions on plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, and PKM2 monomer is known to bind T3 and, as a result, prevent activation of the kinase via tetramer formation. Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone may have different structure-activity relationships of iodothyronines from those effects that depend upon nuclear receptors; they may have different time courses and may invoke complex signal transduction pathways before the action is detected.},

The use, in the present study, of an anion-column chromatographic method for separation of serum T(3) as well as thyroxine (T(4)) from these iodoproteins has overcome this technical handicap. Simultaneous measurement of serum (125)I-T(3) and (131)I-T(4) kinetics were performed in 31 subjects from the clinical categories of euthyroid, primary hypothyroid, thyrotoxic and posttreatment hypothyroid Graves' disease, factitial thyrotoxic, and idiopathically high and low thyroxinebinding globulin states. The normal mean T(3) fractional turnover rate (kT(3)) was 0.68 (half-life = 1.0 days), increased in toxic Graves' disease patients to 1.10 (half-life = 0.63 days), and decreased in primary hypothyroid patients to 0.50 (half-life = 1.38 days). The mean T(3) equilibration time averaged 22 hr except in hypothyroid and high thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) patients where the equilibration period was delayed by 10 hr. The mean T(3) distribution space in normal subjects was 38.4 liters. This was reduced in subjects with high TBG levels (26 liters) and increased in patients with low TBG and in all hyperthyroid states (53-55 liters). The normal serum T(3) concentration was estimated by radioimmunoassay to be 0.106 mug/100 ml. Combined with the mean T(3) clearance value of 26.1 liters/day, the calculated T(3) production rate was 27.6 mug/day. The mean T(3) production rate increased to 201 mug/day in thyrotoxic Graves' disease patients and was reduced to 7.6 mug/day in primary hypothyroid subjects. T(3) production rate was normal in subjects with altered TBG states. The ratio of T(3) to T(4) production rate in normal subjects was 0.31 and was unchanged in patients with altered TBG values. This ratio was increased in all Graves' disease patients with the highest value being 0.81 in the posttreatment hypothyroid Graves' disease group. This apparent preferential production of T(3) may have been responsible for the retention of rapid turnover kinetics for T(3) and T(4) observed in treated Graves' disease patients. The finding that factitial thyrotoxic patients also displayed similar rapid T(3) and T(4) turnover kinetics indicates that these alterations are not a unique feature of Graves' disease per se. When comparing the peripheral turnover values for T(3) and T(4) in man, it is apparent that alterations in metabolic status and serum TBG concentration influence both hormones in a parallel manner; however, changes in metabolic status seem to have a greater influence on T(3) kinetics while alterations in TBG concentrations have a greater effect on T(4). These observations probably relate to the differences in TBG binding affinity and peripheral tissue distribution of these two hormones.},

	abstract = {Central hypothyroidism (CH) is defined as hypothyroidism due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH, for which secretion or activity can be impaired at the hypothalamic or pituitary levels. Patients with CH frequently present with multiple other pituitary hormone deficiencies. In addition to classic CH induced by hypothalamic-pituitary tumors or Sheehan syndrome, novel causes include traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage, bexarotene (a retinoid X receptor agonist) therapy, neonates being born to mothers with insufficiently controlled Graves disease, and lymphocytic hypophysitis. Growth hormone therapy, which may be used in children and adults, is now also recognized as a possible cause of unmasking CH in susceptible individuals. In addition, mutations in genes, such as TRHR, POU1F1, PROP1, HESX1, SOX3, LHX3, LHX4 and TSHB, have been associated with CH. The difficulty in making a clear diagnosis of CH is that the serum TSH levels can vary; values are normal in most cases, but in some might be low or slightly elevated. Levels of endogenous T(4) in serum might also be subnormal. Appropriate doses of levothyroxine for T(4) replacement therapy have not been confirmed, but might need to be higher than presently used empirically in patients with CH and should be adjusted according to age and other hormone deficiencies, to achieve free T(4) concentrations in the upper end of the normal range.},

Predicting the type and amount of seaweed the Japanese consume is difficult due to day-to-day meal variation and dietary differences between generations and regions. In addition, iodine content varies considerably between seaweed species, with cooking and/or processing having an influence on iodine content. Due to all these factors, researchers frequently overestimate, or underestimate, Japanese iodine intake from seaweeds, which results in misleading and potentially dangerous diet and supplementation recommendations for people aiming to achieve the same health benefits seen by the Japanese. By combining information from dietary records, food surveys, urine iodine analysis (both spot and 24-hour samples) and seaweed iodine content, we estimate that the Japanese iodine intake--largely from seaweeds--averages 1,000-3,000 μg/day (1-3 mg/day).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition. METHODS The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group. RESULTS Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. CONCLUSIONS One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.},

Although most cases are asymptomatic, symptoms related to tumor size and its relationship with surrounding tissues may also appear. Any disease affecting the thyroid gland may also involve the ectopic thyroid, including malignancy. The clinician must distinguish between ectopic thyroid and metastatic deposits emerging from an orthotopic gland, as well as other benign or malignant masses. Thyroid scintigraphy plays the most important role in diagnosing ectopy, but ultrasonography contributes as well. In cases of symptomatic disease, surgery is the treatment of choice, followed by radioiodine ablation and levothyroxine suppression therapy in more refractory cases.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement, mean difference, and the detection and control rates of hypertension, between home and clinic blood pressure (BP) measurement in the Finnish population. Variation in home BP during the measurements was also examined. METHODS: We studied a representative sample of the adult population (2051 45-74-year-old individuals) in Finland. Subjects included in the study underwent a clinical interview and measurement of clinic and home BP. Thresholds for elevated clinic and home BP were 140/90 and 135/85 mmHg. RESULTS: The mean difference between home and clinic BP, which increased with BP, was 7.7/3.4 mmHg. Overall agreement in diagnosis was only 75.2\% (kappa coefficient 0.50). As compared with home BP, clinic BP overestimated the prevalence of hypertension (48.8 versus 42.5\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and non-significantly underestimated the control of hypertension (28.7 versus 32.8\%, P = 0.11). Evening home BP was 4.1/0.4 mmHg higher than morning BP among untreated subjects, but this difference was non-existent or reversed (0.5/-1.4 mmHg) among treated hypertensive individuals. Home BP decreased with an increasing number of measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between home and clinic BP in diagnosing hypertension according to the current guidelines is moderate at best, and the difference between home and clinic BP becomes larger at higher levels of BP. Because of the noticeable differences between these two methods, and the better prognostic accuracy of home BP, we endorse the use of home measurements in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {It has been noted that hypothyroidism in pregnant women can adversely affect the children's subsequent psychoneurotic development. Also, transient elevation of serum free thyroxine is occasionally seen in the first trimester of normal pregnancy. However, normal thyroid function during pregnancy and the puerperal period has not been clearly defined in Japan. The aim of this study was to assess maternal thyroid function during pregnancy and puerperal period in Japan. The concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodo-thyronine (free T(3)), free thyroxine (free T(4)) and thyroid binding capacity (TBC) of 522 normal pregnant and puerperal women (119 in the first trimester; 132 in the second trimester; 135 in the third trimester and 136 in the early puerperium) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the measured data with those of healthy nonpregnant control. Twenty-six (21.8\%) of 119 women in the first trimester had lower TSH levels and 23 (16.9\%) of 136 women in the early puerperium had higher TSH levels than the normal range of healthy nonpregnant controls. Free T(3) gradually decreased during pregnancy, although it remained within the normal control range. Eight (6.7\%) of 119 women in the first trimester had high free T(4) levels, which gradually decreased during pregnancy. Sixty (44.4\%) of 135 women in the third trimester had low free T(4) levels. The values of TBC in the second trimester increased compared with the first trimester and did not change in the third trimester and decreased after delivery. There were no correlations between maternal TSH and levels of thyroid hormones (free T(3) or free T(4)), except for TSH and free T(4) in the first trimester. In conclusion, we showed that maternal thyroid function, especially TSH and free T(4), changed during the course of pregnancy. In assessing the thyroid function associated with pregnancy, one needs to keep in mind the tendency toward low free T(4) levels in the third trimester and high TSH levels in the early puerperal period.},

The results showed that high iodine intake strengthened the thyroid function and enhanced the synthesis of organic iodine. The rate of organic iodine synthesis exceeded T3,T4 secretion and the accumulation of organic iodine in the follicules exerted pressure inhibition on follicular epithelium, and then the levels of serum T3 and T4 dropped down. The negative feedback effect on the pituitary became weak. The secretion of thyrotropin rose and the hyperplasia of thyroid epithelium appeared. Therefore, we propose that the follicular distension resulting from the accumulation of organic iodine and the epithelial hyperplasia induced by rise of TSH are two different stages of the pathogenesis of iodine-induced goiter.},

STUDIES REVIEWED Therapeutic benefit of niacin, fibrates, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors on cardiovascular events (all cause mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke). RESULTS 117,411 patients were randomised in a total of 39 trials. All interventions increased the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. No significant effect was seen on all cause mortality for niacin (odds ratio 1.03, 95\% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.15, P=0.59), fibrates (0.98, 0.89 to 1.08, P=0.66), or CETP inhibitors (1.16, 0.93 to 1.44, P=0.19); on coronary heart disease mortality for niacin (0.93, 0.76 to 1.12, P=0.44), fibrates (0.92, 0.81 to 1.04, P=0.19), or CETP inhibitors (1.00, 0.80 to 1.24, P=0.99); or on stroke outcomes for niacin (0.96, 0.75 to 1.22, P=0.72), fibrates (1.01, 0.90 to 1.13, P=0.84), or CETP inhibitors (1.14, 0.90 to 1.45, P=0.29). In studies with patients not receiving statins (before the statin era), niacin was associated with a significant reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.69, 0.56 to 0.85, P=0.0004). However, in studies where statins were already being taken, niacin showed no significant effect (0.96, 0.85 to 1.09, P=0.52). A significant difference was seen between these subgroups (P=0.007). A similar trend relating to non-fatal myocardial infarction was seen with fibrates: without statin treatment (0.78, 0.71 to 0.86, P{\textless}0.001) and with all or some patients taking statins (0.83, 0.69 to 1.01, P=0.07); P=0.58 for difference. CONCLUSIONS Neither niacin, fibrates, nor CETP inhibitors, three highly effective agents for increasing high density lipoprotein levels, reduced all cause mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients treated with statins. Although observational studies might suggest a simplistic hypothesis for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, that increasing the levels pharmacologically would generally reduce cardiovascular events, in the current era of widespread use of statins in dyslipidaemia, substantial trials of these three agents do not support this concept.},

	abstract = {High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) represent a spectrum of particles that vary in their physicochemical and functional properties.1 It has been shown in many population studies that the concentration of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely related to the risk of having a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event. In this paradigm, HDL-C has been considered to be a marker of the potentially cardioprotective functions of HDL. However, recent studies have suggested that the simple concentration of HDL-C may not always reflect HDL function, with growing evidence that under some circumstances HDL function may be compromised despite high concentrations of HDL-C. The best known of the potentially antiatherogenic functions of HDLs is their ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells, including that from macrophages in the arterial wall.2 Cellular cholesterol efflux is achieved by several mechanisms. One involves the interaction of phospholipid-depleted and cholesterol-deficient apolipoprotein (apo) A-I complexes (discoidal, pre–β-migrating particles [very small HDL] with the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in a process that results in the formation of a heterogeneous population of nascent HDL particles that are discoidal in shape and contain apoA-I, phospholipids, and free cholesterol. A proportion of the free cholesterol is subsequently esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT); this enzyme generates a core of cholesteryl esters in a process that converts HDL particles from discoidal, very small, pre-β1-migrating particles into spherical, α-migrating particles (small HDL]).1 The interaction of spherical HDL particles with other active cellular transporters such as ABCG1 and passive diffusion of cellular cholesterol further increase the cholesterol load of HDL. However, it is often unappreciated that peripheral cholesterol efflux contributes {\textless}5\% of the cholesterol content of HDL.2 Thus, HDL-C is an inadequate surrogate measure for the most heralded of HDL functions. Various HDL subpopulations differ in other antiatherogenic functions that extend beyond macrophage …},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with evidence of vascular disease are at increased risk for subsequent vascular events despite effective use of statins to lower the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level. Niacin lowers the LDL cholesterol level and raises the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but its clinical efficacy and safety are uncertain. METHODS After a prerandomization run-in phase to standardize the background statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy and to establish participants' ability to take extended-release niacin without clinically significant adverse effects, we randomly assigned 25,673 adults with vascular disease to receive 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40 mg of laropiprant or a matching placebo daily. The primary outcome was the first major vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, death from coronary causes, stroke, or arterial revascularization). RESULTS During a median follow-up period of 3.9 years, participants who were assigned to extended-release niacin-laropiprant had an LDL cholesterol level that was an average of 10 mg per deciliter (0.25 mmol per liter as measured in the central laboratory) lower and an HDL cholesterol level that was an average of 6 mg per deciliter (0.16 mmol per liter) higher than the levels in those assigned to placebo. Assignment to niacin-laropiprant, as compared with assignment to placebo, had no significant effect on the incidence of major vascular events (13.2\% and 13.7\% of participants with an event, respectively; rate ratio, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.03; P=0.29). Niacin-laropiprant was associated with an increased incidence of disturbances in diabetes control that were considered to be serious (absolute excess as compared with placebo, 3.7 percentage points; P{\textless}0.001) and with an increased incidence of diabetes diagnoses (absolute excess, 1.3 percentage points; P{\textless}0.001), as well as increases in serious adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal system (absolute excess, 1.0 percentage point; P{\textless}0.001), musculoskeletal system (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P{\textless}0.001), skin (absolute excess, 0.3 percentage points; P=0.003), and unexpectedly, infection (absolute excess, 1.4 percentage points; P{\textless}0.001) and bleeding (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among participants with atherosclerotic vascular disease, the addition of extended-release niacin-laropiprant to statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events but did increase the risk of serious adverse events.

We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular causes, the development of heart failure, and hospitalization for heart failure among patients with ejection fractions of 0.35 or less who were not receiving drug treatment for heart failure. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 2117) or enalapril (n = 2111) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-blind trial. Follow-up averaged 37.4 months. RESULTS There were 334 deaths in the placebo group, as compared with 313 in the enalapril group (reduction in risk, 8 percent by the log-rank test; 95 percent confidence interval, -8 percent [an increase of 8 percent] to 21 percent; P = 0.30). The reduction in mortality from cardiovascular causes was larger but was not statistically significant (298 deaths in the placebo group vs. 265 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 12 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -3 to 26 percent; P = 0.12). When we combined patients in whom heart failure developed and those who died, the total number of deaths and cases of heart failure was lower in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (630 vs. 818; risk reduction, 29 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 36 percent; P less than 0.001). In addition, fewer patients given enalapril died or were hospitalized for heart failure (434 in the enalapril group; vs. 518 in the placebo group; risk reduction, 20 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 30 percent; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced the incidence of heart failure and the rate of related hospitalizations, as compared with the rates in the group given placebo, among patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.

HDL cholesterol efflux capacity-a prototypical measure of HDL function-has been associated with coronary heart disease after adjusting for HDL cholesterol, but its effect on incident coronary heart disease risk is uncertain. METHODS We measured cholesterol efflux capacity and assessed its relation with vascular risk factors and incident coronary heart disease events in a nested case-control sample from the prospective EPIC-Norfolk study of 25 639 individuals aged 40-79 years, assessed in 1993-97 and followed up to 2009. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity in 1745 patients with incident coronary heart disease and 1749 control participants free of any cardiovascular disorders by use of a validated ex-vivo radiotracer assay that involved incubation of cholesterol-labelled J774 macrophages with apoB-depleted serum from study participants. FINDINGS Cholesterol efflux capacity was positively correlated with HDL cholesterol concentration (r=0·40; p{\textless}0·0001) and apoA-I concentration (r=0·22; p{\textless}0·0001). It was also inversely correlated with type 2 diabetes (r=-0·18; p{\textless}0·0001) and positively correlated with alcohol consumption (r=0·12; p{\textless}0·0001). In analyses comparing the top and bottom tertiles, cholesterol efflux capacity was significantly and inversely associated with incident coronary heart disease events, independent of age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use, waist:hip ratio, BMI, LDL cholesterol concentration, log-triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol or apoA-I concentrations (odds ratio 0·64, 95\% CI 0·51-0·80). After a similar multivariable adjustment the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 0·80 (95\% CI 0·70-0·90) for a per-SD change in cholesterol efflux capacity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. METHODS We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. FINDINGS In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7·0\% [95\% uncertainty interval 6·2-7·7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·3\% [5·5-7·0]), and alcohol use (5·5\% [5·0-5·9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7·9\% [6·8-9·4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 7·0\% [5·6-8·3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·1\% [5·4-6·8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10·0\% (95\% UI 9·2-10·8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0·9\% (0·4-1·6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. INTERPRETATION Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children. FUNDING Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

	abstract = {Background: In the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD), enalapril reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic but not asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction during the trial. We did a 12-year follow-up of SOLVD to establish if the mortality reduction with enalapril among patients with heart failure was sustained, and whether a subsequent reduction in mortality would emerge among those with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction. Methods: Of the 6797 patients previously enrolled in the SOLVD prevention and treatment trials, we ascertained the subsequent vital status of 5165 individuals who were alive when the trials had been completed. Follow-up was done through direct contacts in Belgium and linkages with national death registries and federal beneficiary or historic tax summary files in the USA and Canada. Findings: Follow-up was 99.8\% (6784/6797) complete. In the prevention trial, 50.9\% (1074/2111) of the enalapril group had died compared with 56.4\% (1195/2117) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.001). In the treatment trial, 79.8\% (1025/1285) of the enalapril group had died compared with 80.8\% (1038/1284) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.01). The reductions in cardiac deaths were significant and similar in both trials. When data for the prevention and treatment trials were combined, the hazard ratio for death was 0.90 for the enalapril group compared with the placebo group (95\% CI 0.84-0.95, generalised Wilcoxon p=0.0003). Enalapril extended median survival by 9.4 months in the combined trials (95\% CI 2.8-16.5, p=0.004). Interpretation: Treatment with enalapril for 3-4 years led to a sustained improvement in survival beyond the original trial period in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an important increase in life expectancy.},

Cases younger than 18 yr of age were also excluded from the study. Outcome Measures: The status of patients was investigated at 2, 5, and 7 yr after diagnosis. Results:We identified 2024 cases with SH, a prevalence of 0.63\% and an incidence of 29 per 100,000 in 2008. Most SH cases without thyroid treatment remained as SH at 2 (81.8\%), 5 (67.5\%), and 7 yr (63.0\%) after diagnosis. Few patients (0.5–0.7\%) developed hyperthyroidism at 2, 5, and 7 yr. The percentage of SH cases reverting to normal increased with time: 17.2\% (2 yr), 31.5\% (5 yr), and 35.6\% (7 yr), and this was more common in SH patients with baseline TSH between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/liter.

OBJECTIVE The aim of our study was to investigate the potential association of thyroid function, as defined by serum concentrations of the clinically used primary thyroid function marker thyrotropin [i.e. thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] and 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2), with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) as a marker of PAD. METHODS We used data from 5,818 individuals from three cross-sectional population-based studies conducted in Northeast (SHIP-2 and SHIP-TREND) and Central Germany (CARLA). Measurement of serum TSH concentrations was conducted in one central laboratory for all three studies. In a randomly selected subpopulation of 750 individuals of SHIP-TREND, serum 3,5-T2 concentrations were measured with a recently developed immunoassay. ABI was measured either by a hand-held Doppler ultrasound using the Huntleigh Dopplex D900 or palpatorily by the OMRON HEM-705CP device. RESULTS Serum TSH concentrations were not significantly associated with ABI values in any of the three studies. Likewise, groups of individuals with a TSH {\textless}0.3 mIU/l or with a TSH ≥3.0 mIU/l had no significantly different ABI values in comparison with individuals with a TSH in the reference range. Analyses regarding TSH within the reference range or serum 3,5-T2 concentrations did not reveal consistent significant associations with the ABI. No sex-specific associations were detected. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study do not substantiate evidence for an association between thyroid function and PAD, but further studies are needed to investigate the associations of overt forms of thyroid dysfunction with PAD.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Perturbations in thyroid function are common in older individuals but their significance in the very old is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE This study sought to determine whether thyroid hormone status and variation of thyroid hormones within the reference range correlated with mortality and disability in a cohort of 85-year-olds. DESIGN A cohort of 85-year-old individuals were assessed in their own homes (community or institutional care) for health status and thyroid function, and followed for mortality and disability for up to 9 years. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Six hundred and forty-three 85-year-olds registered with participating general practices in Newcastle and North Tyneside, United Kingdom. MAIN OUTCOMES All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and disability according to thyroid disease status and baseline thyroid hormone parameters (serum TSH, FT4, FT3, and rT3). Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index, smoking, and disease count. RESULTS After adjustment for age and sex, all-cause mortality was associated with baseline serum rT3 and FT3 (both P {\textless} .001), but not FT4 or TSH. After additional adjustment for potential confounders, only rT3 remained significantly associated with mortality (P = .001). Baseline serum TSH and rT3 predicted future disability trajectories in men and women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our study is reassuring that individuals age 85 y with both subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism do not have a significantly worse survival over 9 years than their euthyroid peers. However, thyroid function tests did predict disability, with higher serum TSH levels predicting better outcomes. These data strengthen the argument for routine use of age-specific thyroid function reference ranges.},

PARTICIPANTS Pediatric residents (n = 51), medicine-pediatric residents (n = 6), continuity clinic faculty (n = 22), and certified-registered nurse practitioners (n = 5). RESULTS Prior to implementation of the DV education program, respondents correctly answered questions about the prevalence of DV (74 participants [90\%]), the racial distribution of DV victims (66 participants [80\%]), and the significant overlap between child abuse and DV (75 participants [91\%]). Seventy-nine participants (96\%) believed that screening for the presence of DV was part of their role as pediatric health care providers. At baseline, 17 (21\%) of the 82 participants reported that they were routinely screening for signs of DV during well-child care visits compared with 39 (46\%) after attending the education program (P =.005). Among participants who attended both educational session 25\% (9/36) were routinely screening for the presence of DV prior to the intervention, compared with 46\% (16/35) after the intervention (P =.008). At baseline, 33 (40\%) of the 82 participants had identified at least 1 case of DV in the prior 6 months compared with 45 (53\%) after training.

SETTING Two urban, hospital-based emergency departments. PARTICIPANTS Of 491 women presenting during 48 randomly selected 4-hour time blocks, 322 (76\% of eligible patients) participated. Respondents had a median age of 36 years; 19\% were black, 45\% white, and 30\% Hispanic, while 6\% were of other racial or ethnic groups; 54\% were insured. INTERVENTIONS We developed a partner violence screen (PVS), consisting of 3 questions about past physical violence and perceived personal safety. We administered the PVS and 2 standardized measures of partner violence, the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) and the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the PVS were compared with the ISA and the CTS as criterion standards. RESULTS The prevalence rate of partner violence using the PVS was 29.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 24.6\%-34.8\%). For the ISA and CTS, the prevalence rates were 24.3\% (95\% CI, 19.2\%-30.1 \%) and 27.4\% (95\% CI, 21.7\%-33.6\%), respectively. Compared with the ISA, the sensitivity of the PVS in detecting partner abuse was 64.5\%; the specificity was 80.3\%. When compared with the CTS, sensitivity of the PVS was 71.4\%; the specificity was 84.4\%. Positive predictive values ranged from 51.3\% to 63.4\%, and negative predictive values ranged from 87.6\% to 88.7\%. Overall, 13.7\% of visits were the result of acute episodes of partner violence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Domestic violence is an important problem that is often not recognized by physicians. We designed a short instrument for domestic violence screening that could be easily remembered and administered by family physicians. METHODS In phase one of the study, 160 adult female family practice office patients living with a partner for at least 12 months completed two questionnaires. One questionnaire was the verbal and physical aggression items of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS). The other was a new four-item questionnaire that asked respondents how often their partner physically Hurt, Insulted, Threatened with harm, and Screamed at them. These four items make the acronym HITS. In phase two, 99 women, who were self-identified victims of domestic violence, completed the HITS. RESULTS For phase one, Cronbach's alpha was .80 for the HITS scale. The correlation of HITS and CTS scores was .85. For phase two, the mean HITS scores for office patients and abuse victims were 6.13 and 15.15, respectively. Optimal data analysis revealed that a cut score of 10.5 on the HITS reliably differentiated respondents in the two groups. Using this cut score, 91\% of patients and 96\% of abuse victims were accurately classified. CONCLUSIONS The HITS scale showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity with the CTS verbal and physical aggression items. The HITS scale also showed good construct validity in its ability to differentiate family practice patients from abuse victims. The HITS scale is promising as a domestic violence screening mnemonic for family practice physicians and residents.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the impact of lifetime physical, psychological, and sexual intimate male partner violence (IPV) on the mental health of women, after controlling for the contribution of lifetime victimization. The comorbidity of depressive symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their relation to state anxiety and suicide were also assessed. METHODS Physically/psychologically (n = 75) and psychologically abused women (n = 55) were compared with nonabused control women (n = 52). Information about sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime victimization, and mental health status (depressive and state anxiety symptoms, PTSD, and suicide) was obtained through face-to-face structured interviews. RESULTS Women exposed to physical/psychological and psychological IPV had a higher incidence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, PTSD, and thoughts of suicide than control women, with no differences between the two abused groups. The concomitance of sexual violence was associated with a higher severity of depressive symptoms in both abused groups and a higher incidence of suicide attempts in the physically/psychologically abused group. The incidence of PTSD alone was very rare, and depressive symptoms were either alone or comorbid with PTSD. The severity of state anxiety was higher in abused women with depressive symptoms or comorbidity, as was the incidence of suicidal thoughts in the physically/psychologically abused group. Lifetime victimization was not a predictor of the deterioration of mental health in this study. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that psychological IPV is as detrimental as physical IPV, with the exception of effects on suicidality, which emphasizes that psychological IPV should be considered a major type of violence by all professionals involved.},

The American Academy of Pediatrics has recently called on pediatricians, informed by research from molecular biology, genomics, immunology, and neuroscience, to become leaders in science-based strategies to build strong foundations for children's life-long health. In this report, we provide an overview of the science of toxic stress. We summarize the development of the neuroendocrine-immune network, how its function is altered by early life adversity, and how these alterations then increase vulnerability to disease. The fact that early environments shape and calibrate the functioning of biological systems very early in life is both a cautionary tale about overlooking critical periods in development and reason for optimism about the promise of intervention. Even in the most extreme cases of adversity, well-timed changes to children's environments can improve outcomes. Pediatricians are in a unique position to contribute to the public discourse on health and social welfare by explaining how factors that seem distal to child health may be the key to some of the most intractable public health problems of our generation. We consider the challenges and opportunities for preventing toxic stress in the context of contemporary pediatric practice.},

ACE questions included physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; substance use, mental illness or incarceration of a household member; domestic violence, and parental separation. Outcomes included chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, depression, diabetes, and prediabetes); overall health status; and days of poor mental or physical health in the past month. We estimated Poisson regression models of the likelihood of chronic conditions and poor health status comparing adults reporting ≥4 ACEs to respondents with no ACEs within three age strata: 18-34, 35-54 and ≥55 years. The prevalence of ≥4 ACEs was highest among youngest respondents (19\%). There was a dose-response gradient between ACE scores and outcomes except for cancer in older adults. Among younger respondents, those reporting ≥4 ACEs had two to four times the risk for each chronic condition and poor health status compared to respondents reporting no ACEs. With few exceptions (depression, poor mental and physical health in the past month), incidence rate ratios were highest in young adults and successively decreased among older adults. This study is among the first to analyze patterns of association between ACEs and adult health disaggregated by age. Young adults with high ACE scores are at increased risk of early-onset chronic disease. Trauma-informed care and ACEs prevention are crucial public health priorities.},

The predominant symptom, dyspnoea induced by upright posture, can be debilitating and difficult to discern without thorough evaluation of the patient's pattern of dyspnoea. The precise cause of the syndrome is unclear but patients develop right to left intracardiac shunting in the presence of normal right sided cardiac pressures. Initially, patients should have confirmation of orthostatic desaturation by erect and supine pulse oximetry. However, definitive diagnosis of an orthostatic intracardiac shunt is most readily established by echocardiography. The use of echocontrast with postural manoeuvres may facilitate the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical closure of the intracardiac (usually interatrial) communication, which may result in dramatic symptomatic and haemodynamic improvement. Three cases (a 27 year old man and two women aged 63 and 72 years) are described that exemplify the presentation of this syndrome, and reflect the varied management strategies and outcomes of this condition.},

Sedative and analgesic medications relieve anxiety and pain but may contribute to patients' transitioning into delirium. METHODS In this cohort study, the authors designed a priori an investigation to determine whether sedative and analgesic medications independently increased the probability of daily transition to delirium. Markov regression modeling (adjusting for 11 covariates) was used in the evaluation of 198 mechanically ventilated patients to determine the probability of daily transition to delirium as a function of sedative and analgesic dose administration during the previous 24 h. RESULTS Lorazepam was an independent risk factor for daily transition to delirium (odds ratio, 1.2 [95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4]; P = 0.003), whereas fentanyl, morphine, and propofol were associated with higher but not statistically significant odds ratios. Increasing age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were also independent predictors of transitioning to delirium (multivariable P values {\textless} 0.05).

A formal cognitive assessment and history of acute onset of symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. In view of the complex multifactorial causes of delirium, multicomponent non-pharmacological risk factor approaches are the most effective strategy for prevention. No convincing evidence shows that pharmacological prevention or treatment is effective. Drug reduction for sedation and analgesia and non-pharmacological approaches are recommended. Delirium offers opportunities to elucidate brain pathophysiology--it serves both as a marker of brain vulnerability with decreased reserve and as a potential mechanism for permanent cognitive damage. As a potent indicator of patients' safety, delirium provides a target for system-wide process improvements.

INTERVENTION Antipsychotic administration for delirium prevention or treatment in randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. MEASUREMENTS Two authors independently reviewed all citations, extracted relevant data, and assessed studies for potential bias. Heterogeneity was considered as chi-square P {\textless} .1 or I(2) {\textgreater} 50\%. Using a random-effects model (I(2) {\textgreater} 50\%) or a fixed-effects model (I(2) {\textless} 50\%), odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes (delirium incidence and mortality), and mean or standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes (delirium duration, severity, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS)). Sensitivity analyses included postoperative prevention studies only, exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, and typical versus atypical antipsychotics. RESULTS Screening of 10,877 eligible records identified 19 studies. In seven studies comparing antipsychotics with placebo or no treatment for delirium prevention after surgery, there was no significant effect on delirium incidence (OR = 0.56, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.34, I(2) = 93\%). Using data reported from all 19 studies, antipsychotic use was not associated with change in delirium duration, severity, or hospital or ICU LOS, with high heterogeneity among studies. No association with mortality was detected (OR = 0.90, 95\% CI = 0.62-1.29, I(2) = 0\%). CONCLUSION Current evidence does not support the use of antipsychotics for prevention or treatment of delirium.

RV pacing creates electrical dyssynchrony similar to a left-bundle branch block, with conduction occurring cell-by-cell rather than through the His-Purkinje network. Studies have shown that impairment of myocardial metabolism, structure, and function related to RV pacing occurs regionally (most prominently near the pacing site) and globally, within the left ventricle. Strategies being studied to prevent or treat pacing-induced intraventricular mechanical dyssynchrony and HF include: initial biventricular rather than RV pacing in selected patients, programming to avoid or minimize RV pacing, use of alternate (non-apical) RV pacing sites, echocardiographic screening for development of pacing-induced dyssynchrony and HF, and upgrade to biventricular pacing.},

RESULTS Sex and age distribution, major risk factors and comorbidities, recurrent stroke, treatment strategies, and outcome were all unevenly distributed among stroke subtypes (P{\textless}0.001, respectively). Cardioembolism, the most frequent etiology of stroke (25.6\%), was particularly common in the elderly (those aged {\textgreater}70 years) and associated with an adverse outcome, a low rate of early stroke recurrence, and frequent use of thrombolytic therapy and intravenous anticoagulation. Large-artery atherosclerosis (20.9\%), the most common cause of stroke in middle-aged patients (those aged 45 to 70 years), showed the highest male preponderance, highest rate of early stroke recurrence, and highest prevalence of previous transient ischemic attack, current smoking, and daily alcohol consumption among all subtypes. The highest prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity was found in small-vessel disease (20.5\%), which, in turn, was associated with the lowest stroke severity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our results foster the concept of ischemic stroke as a polyetiologic disease with marked differences between subtypes regarding risk factors and outcome. Therefore, studies involving risk factors of ischemic stroke should differentiate between etiologic stroke subtypes.},

As myocardium is a main target of thyroid hormone action, we investigated whether sHT induces cardiovascular alterations. Twenty sHT patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-T(4) therapy and were followed for 1 yr. Twenty sex- and age-matched normal subjects served as controls. Doppler echocardiography and videodensitometric analysis were performed in all subjects. Myocardium textural parameters were obtained as mean gray levels, which were then used to calculate the cyclic variation index (CVI; percent systolic/diastolic change in mean gray levels). Patients had a significantly higher isovolumic relaxation time (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.6; P {\textless} 0.03), peak A (0.77 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.13 m/s; P {\textless} 0.01), and preejection/ejection time (PEP/ET) ratio (0.72 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.06; P {\textless} 0.03) and a lower CVI (P {\textless} 0.0001) than controls. CVI was inversely related to TSH level (P {\textless} 0.0001) and PEP/ET ratio (P {\textless} 0.01). L-T(4)-treated patients showed a significant reduction of the PEP/ET ratio (P {\textless} 0.05), peak A (P {\textless} 0.05), and isovolumic relaxation time (P {\textless} 0.05) along with a normalization of CVI. Conversely, no changes were observed in the placebo-treated group. In conclusion, sHT affects both myocardial structure and contractility. These alterations may be reversed by L-T(4) therapy.},

We examined the association between TSH and total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in men and women from the general population. Furthermore, the association with TSH outside and within the reference range and lipid levels was studied. METHODS Individual data of 13,571 men and women without lipid medication of four population-based studies conducted in Western European adults were pooled for cross-sectional analyses. The association between TSH levels and lipid concentrations were analyzed by calculating sex-specific multivariable median regression models. RESULTS In the pooled population, serum TSH levels were significantly positively associated with triglyceride values in men and with total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride values in women. In the pooled male population, low serum TSH levels ({\textless}3.0 mIU/L) were significantly associated with lower total cholesterol, while high serum TSH levels (≥ 3.0 mIU/L) were associated with higher triglyceride values. In the pooled female population, low serum TSH levels were significantly associated with lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. High TSH levels were associated with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the pooled female population. In both sexes, serum TSH levels within the reference range (0.3-3.0 mIU/L) were significantly positively associated with triglyceride concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Increasing levels of TSH were associated with a less favorable lipid profile in both men and women from the general population.

We therefore investigated the association between a CYP4A11 polymorphism (rs9333025) with hypertension in the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups. We studied 514 Mongolians in a pastoral area, including 201 hypertension patients and 313 normotensive controls, and 524 Han individuals in an urban area, including 215 hypertension patients and 309 normotensive controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Genotype, allele, and dominant inheritance differed significantly between the Mongolian and Han populations (P = 0.006, P = 0.002, and P = 0.003, respectively). Significant differences were also observed in these factors when considering only males (P = 0.001, P = 0.003, and P = 0.001, respectively). For the Han population, recessive inheritance differed significantly between hypertension patients and controls and between male patients and controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.049, respectively). The genotypic, allelic, and dominant frequencies differed significantly between hypertension patients in both populations (P = 0.019, P = 0.035, and P = 0.024, respectively). The genotypic frequency in Mongolian male patients was significantly different from that in Han male patients (P = 0.009). Higher body mass index, triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein were associated with increased risk of developing hypertension in the Han population. The GG genotype was in higher frequency in the Mongolian population, indicating that it is a high risk factor for hypertension. Mongolian men were at higher risk of developing hypertension.},

This review highlights the results of the recent genetic studies in humans and rodent models, indicating that these eicosanoids participate in the control of blood pressure (BP), chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). RECENT FINDINGS Endogenous 20-HETE has been reported to play an essential role in the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback responses in the afferent arteriole, and a deficiency of 20-HETE contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in Dahl S rats. Mutations in CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 have been linked to elevated BP in humans. EETs have been shown to regulate epithelial sodium channel in the collecting duct, lower BP and have renoprotective properties. 20-HETE also opposes the development of CKD and IRI, and may play a role in PKD. SUMMARY These studies indicate that CYP P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid play an important role in the control of BP, CKD, AKI and PKD. Drugs targeting these pathways could be useful in the treatment of IRI and CKD.},

According to the Mendelian randomization method, the association is likely to be causal if genetic variants that affect CRP level are associated with markers of diabetes development and diabetes. Our objective was to examine the nature of the association between CRP phenotype and diabetes development using CRP haplotypes as instrumental variables. METHODS AND FINDINGS We genotyped three tagging SNPs (CRP + 2302G {\textgreater} A; CRP + 1444T {\textgreater} C; CRP + 4899T {\textgreater} G) in the CRP gene and measured serum CRP in 5,274 men and women at mean ages 49 and 61 y (Whitehall II Study). Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured at age 61 y. Diabetes was ascertained by glucose tolerance test and self-report. Common major haplotypes were strongly associated with serum CRP levels, but unrelated to obesity, blood pressure, and socioeconomic position, which may confound the association between CRP and diabetes risk. Serum CRP was associated with these potential confounding factors. After adjustment for age and sex, baseline serum CRP was associated with incident diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.39 [95\% confidence interval 1.29-1.51], HOMA-IR, and HbA1c, but the associations were considerably attenuated on adjustment for potential confounding factors. In contrast, CRP haplotypes were not associated with HOMA-IR or HbA1c (p = 0.52-0.92). The associations of CRP with HOMA-IR and HbA1c were all null when examined using instrumental variables analysis, with genetic variants as the instrument for serum CRP. Instrumental variables estimates differed from the directly observed associations (p = 0.007-0.11). Pooled analysis of CRP haplotypes and diabetes in Whitehall II and Northwick Park Heart Study II produced null findings (p = 0.25-0.88). Analyses based on the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (1,923 diabetes cases, 2,932 controls) using three SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium with our tagging SNPs also demonstrated null associations. CONCLUSIONS Observed associations between serum CRP and insulin resistance, glycemia, and diabetes are likely to be noncausal. Inflammation may play a causal role via upstream effectors rather than the downstream marker CRP.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Although it has been hypothesized that hypertension is in part an inflammatory disorder, clinical data linking inflammation with incident hypertension are scarce. OBJECTIVE To examine whether C-reactive protein levels, a marker of systemic inflammation, are associated with incident hypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study that began in 1992 of 20 525 female US health professionals aged 45 years or older who provided baseline blood samples with initially normal levels of blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP {\textless}140 mm Hg and diastolic BP {\textless}90 mm Hg, and no history of hypertension or antihypertensive medications) and then followed up for a median of 7.8 years for the development of incident hypertension. Plasma C-reactive protein levels were measured and baseline coronary risk factors were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incident hypertension, defined as either a new physician diagnosis, the initiation of antihypertensive treatment, or self-reported systolic BP of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of at least 90 mm Hg. RESULTS During follow-up, 5365 women developed incident hypertension. In crude models, the relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing hypertension from the lowest (referent) to the highest levels of baseline C-reactive protein were 1.00, 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.40), 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.35-1.68), 1.90 (95\% CI, 1.72-2.11), and 2.50 (95\% CI, 2.27-2.75) (linear trend P{\textless}.001). In fully adjusted models for coronary risk factors, the RRs and 95\% CIs were 1.00, 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.95-1.20), 1.17 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.31), 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.45), and 1.52 (95\% CI, 1.36-1.69) (linear trend P{\textless}.001). C-reactive protein was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in all prespecified subgroups evaluated, including those with very low levels of baseline BP, as well as those with no traditional coronary risk factors. Similar results were found when treating C-reactive protein as a continuous variable and controlling for baseline BP. CONCLUSION C-reactive protein levels are associated with future development of hypertension, which suggests that hypertension is in part an inflammatory disorder.},

	abstract = {Aims Parental hypertension is known to predict high blood pressure (BP) in children. However, the extent to which risk for hypertension is conferred across multiple generations, notwithstanding the impact of environmental factors, is unclear. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the degree to which risk for hypertension extends across multiple generations of individuals in the community. Methods and results We studied three generations of Framingham Heart Study participants with standardized blood pressure measurements performed at serial examinations spanning 5 decades (1948 through 2005): First Generation (n = 1809), Second Generation (n = 2631), and Third Generation (n = 3608, mean age 39 years, 53\% women). To capture a more precise estimate of conferrable risk, we defined early-onset hypertension (age {\textless}55 years) as the primary exposure. In multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for standard risk factors as well as physical activity and daily intake of dietary sodium, risk for hypertension in the Third Generation was conferred simultaneously by presence of early-onset hypertension in parents [OR 2.10 (95\% CI, 1.66-2.67), P {\textless} 0.001] as well as in grandparents [OR 1.33 (95\% CI, 1.12-1.58), P {\textless} 0.01]. Conclusion Early-onset hypertension in grandparents raises the risk for hypertension in grandchildren, even after adjusting for early-onset hypertension in parents and lifestyle factors. These results suggest that a substantial familial predisposition for hypertension exists, and this predisposition is not identical when assessed from one generation to the next. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying transgenerational risk for hypertension and its clinical implications.},

	abstract = {Arachidonic acid is a major fatty acid that can be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme to a number of bioactive eicosanoids. A major metabolite of this oxidation is 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which acts as a potent vasoconstrictor. However, in the kidney, its vasoconstrictor actions can be offset by its natriuretic properties. A guanine-to-adenine polymorphism in the CYP4F2 gene was associated with a reduction in 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production in vitro. A thymidine-to-cytosine polymorphism in the CYP4A11 gene reduced catalytic activity by {\textgreater}50\% in vitro and was associated with hypertension. The aim was to determine whether these 2 mutations are associated with urinary 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid excretion and blood pressure in humans. For the CYP4F2, 51\% were homozygous for the G allele, 40\% were carriers, and 9\% were homozygous for the A allele. For CYP4A11, 72\% were homozygous for the T allele, 25\% were carriers, and 3\% were homozygous for the C allele. The CYP4F2 GA/AA genotype was significantly associated with an increase in both 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid excretion and systolic blood pressure. The CYP4A11 CC/TC genotype was significantly associated with a reduction in 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid excretion but was not associated with blood pressure. We have demonstrated for the first time in humans that polymorphisms of the CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 genes have opposite effects on 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid excretion. The positive association between the CYP4F2 GA/AA genotype and both systolic blood pressure and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid excretion strengthens a role for 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the modulation of blood pressure.},

In the past several years, progress has been made not only in characterizing the specific CYP-epoxygenases responsible for the regulation of membrane transport and vasoactivity in the kidney but also in exploring the mechanism by which they regulate renal Na transport and vasodilation of preglomerular arterioles. This review summarizes and updates recent progress in this area of research. RECENT FINDINGS CYP-epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid inhibit epithelial Na channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct (CCD), and 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) is mainly responsible for mediating the inhibitory effect on ENaC. Downregulation of CYP2C44 abolishes arachidonic acid mediated inhibition of ENaC and increases ENaC activity. In addition, 11,12-EET stimulates Ca-activated big conductance K channels in the CCD and afferent arterioles smooth muscles. Activation of big conductance K channels by 11,12-EET is responsible for EET-induced vasodilation in preglomerular arterioles. 11,12-EET-induced vasodilation is absent in preglomerular arterioles pretreated with okadaic acid. SUMMARY CYP-epoxygenase mediated suppression of renal Na transport is partially achieved by inhibition of ENaC activity in the CCD and CYP2C44-derived EETs are responsible for inhibition of ENaC. Stimulation of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) contributes to 11,12-EET-induced activation of big conductance K channels and vasodilation in preglomerular arterioles.},

We have previously reported that the TRalpha1-deficient mice have a 20\% lower mean heart rate and a 0.5 degrees C lower body temperature compared with wild-type control animals. In this study we found that when 3,5, 3'-triiodothyronine (T3) was given once a day, there was a parallel increase in heart rate (occurring 1 day later in the TRalpha1-deficient mice than in controls) and body temperature. Analysis of single-lead ECG revealed a prolonged QRS and Q-Tend time in the TRalpha1-deficient mice, which was shortened after T3 treatment. Monophasic action potential durations, measured in hearts from anesthetized mice at 90\% of repolarization, were significantly prolonged in TRalpha1-deficient mice. Air-jet stress and a single injection of an anticholinergic agent induced a parallel increase, and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker induced a decrease in heart rate in both groups. There was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor density. The results indicate that the TRalpha1-deficient mice have a specific defect in intrinsic heart rate regulation.},

	abstract = {Cellular actions of thyroid hormone may be initiated within the cell nucleus, at the plasma membrane, in cytoplasm, and at the mitochondrion. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) mediate the biological activities of T(3) via transcriptional regulation. Two TR genes, alpha and beta, encode four T(3)-binding receptor isoforms (alpha1, beta1, beta2, and beta3). The transcriptional activity of TRs is regulated at multiple levels. Besides being regulated by T(3), transcriptional activity is regulated by the type of thyroid hormone response elements located on the promoters of T(3) target genes, by the developmental- and tissue-dependent expression of TR isoforms, and by a host of nuclear coregulatory proteins. These nuclear coregulatory proteins modulate the transcription activity of TRs in a T(3)-dependent manner. In the absence of T(3), corepressors act to repress the basal transcriptional activity, whereas in the presence of T(3), coactivators function to activate transcription. The critical role of TRs is evident in that mutations of the TRbeta gene cause resistance to thyroid hormones to exhibit an array of symptoms due to decreasing the sensitivity of target tissues to T(3). Genetically engineered knockin mouse models also reveal that mutations of the TRs could lead to other abnormalities beyond resistance to thyroid hormones, including thyroid cancer, pituitary tumors, dwarfism, and metabolic abnormalities. Thus, the deleterious effects of mutations of TRs are more severe than previously envisioned. These genetic-engineered mouse models provide valuable tools to ascertain further the molecular actions of unliganded TRs in vivo that could underlie the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism. Actions of thyroid hormone that are not initiated by liganding of the hormone to intranuclear TR are termed nongenomic. They may begin at the plasma membrane or in cytoplasm. Plasma membrane-initiated actions begin at a receptor on integrin alphavbeta3 that activates ERK1/2 and culminate in local membrane actions on ion transport systems, such as the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, or complex cellular events such as cell proliferation. Concentration of the integrin on cells of the vasculature and on tumor cells explains recently described proangiogenic effects of iodothyronines and proliferative actions of thyroid hormone on certain cancer cells, including gliomas. Thus, hormonal events that begin nongenomically result in effects in DNA-dependent effects. l-T(4) is an agonist at the plasma membrane without conversion to T(3). Tetraiodothyroacetic acid is a T(4) analog that inhibits the actions of T(4) and T(3) at the integrin, including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. T(3) can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by a mechanism that may be cytoplasmic in origin or may begin at integrin alphavbeta3. Downstream consequences of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation by T(3) include specific gene transcription and insertion of Na, K-ATPase in the plasma membrane and modulation of the activity of the ATPase. Thyroid hormone, chiefly T(3) and diiodothyronine, has important effects on mitochondrial energetics and on the cytoskeleton. Modulation by the hormone of the basal proton leak in mitochondria accounts for heat production caused by iodothyronines and a substantial component of cellular oxygen consumption. Thyroid hormone also acts on the mitochondrial genome via imported isoforms of nuclear TRs to affect several mitochondrial transcription factors. Regulation of actin polymerization by T(4) and rT(3), but not T(3), is critical to cell migration. This effect has been prominently demonstrated in neurons and glial cells and is important to brain development. The actin-related effects in neurons include fostering neurite outgrowth. A truncated TRalpha1 isoform that resides in the extranuclear compartment mediates the action of thyroid hormone on the cytoskeleton.},

We have studied the association between normal thyroid function, defined as TSH within the reference range of a general population, and concentrations of serum lipids. DESIGN Cross-sectional, population-based study with 30,656 individuals without known thyroid disease. METHODS Using general linear models, we calculated mean concentrations of total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides across categories of TSH. RESULTS Within the reference range of TSH, there was a linear and significant (P for trend {\textless}0.001) increase in total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a linear decrease (P for trend {\textless}0.001) in HDL cholesterol with increasing TSH. Subgroup analyses showed statistically significant associations for all lipids in men above 50 years of age, and for triglycerides in all age groups. For women, associations were statistically significant in all age groups except for HDL cholesterol in women below 50 years of age. The associations with triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were stronger among overweight than normal weight individuals. CONCLUSIONS Within the range of TSH that is considered clinically normal, we found that increasing level of TSH was associated with less favourable lipid concentrations. The association with serum lipids was linear across the entire reference range of TSH.},

	abstract = {Most thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assays now have the sensitivity required by thyroid guidelines and allow the reliable identification of patients with both overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Clinical guidelines usually quote decision limits for TSH, but often ignore the issue of whether variability in bias between assays should be considered when such decision limits are implemented. Clinicians and laboratories should appreciate that these decision limits arise largely from historical data that used TSH assays with poorly defined bias. It is thus unlikely that laboratories will be able to apply an appropriate method-related bias adjustment to these TSH cut-offs. Clinicians should appreciate that TSH decision limits should thus be regarded as typical target figures rather than an absolute cut-off and thus can be applied with some degree of flexibility. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify a significant lowering of the upper reference limit for TSH, but fine-tuning of current reference ranges is required since there appears to be no association between the ranking of the assay bias in the UK National External Quality Assessment Service scheme and the manufacturers' quoted reference ranges. There is room for further improvement in TSH assays and this can best be achieved if manufacturers, laboratories and clinicians work together to produce TSH assays and reference ranges that show closer agreement between methods. Until this is achieved, future studies that examine the relationship of TSH with symptoms and treatment should ensure that sufficient information is included in the publication to allow the method related bias of the TSH assay to be clearly described.},

Since the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby serum sex steroid concentrations are sensitive to thyroid status, we also measured serum testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG at each time. Stepwise T4 treatment resulted in gradual improvement in thyroid status. Concomitantly, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased in a linear fashion from a mean of 4.72 +/- 0.31 (+/- SEM) to 3.21 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) after the largest dose. In contrast, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased, although not in a dose-dependent fashion, from 1.61 +/- 0.07 to 1.44 +/- 0.05 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) after the largest dose. Serum SHBG increased along with improvement of thyroid function, but this increase did not have major impact on the changes in LDL during T4 treatment, as judged by multiple regression analysis. Thus, serum LDL correlated independently only with T4 (r = -0.38; P less than 0.001). The serum HDL changes were almost exclusively due to those in the HDL2 subfraction, and these were related to HL activity, which increased from 13.4 +/- 1.76 to 18.9 +/- 2.08 U/L after the largest dose. We conclude that thyroid hormones regulated serum HDL (HDL2) cholesterol mainly through their effect on HL.},

	abstract = {Although it has been known for over 50 years that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglyceride in chylomicrons, during the past half decade there has been a reinterest in the physiologic and pathophysiologic actions of this enzyme. In part, this has coincided with clinical studies implicating increased postprandial lipemia as a risk factor for atherosclerosis development. In addition, the recent creation of genetically altered mice with hypertriglyceridemia has focused the interest of geneticists and physiologists on the pathophysiology of triglyceride metabolism. As reviewed in this article, it is apparent that the lipolysis reaction is only partially understood. Several factors other than LPL are critical modulators of this process, in part, because the reaction requires the lipoproteins to interact with the arterial or capillary wall. Among the factors that affect this are the apolipoprotein composition of the particles, the size of the lipoproteins, and how LPL is displayed along the endothelial luminal surface. Zilversmit's observation that LPL activity is found in greater amounts in atherosclerotic than normal arteries has led to a large number of experiments linking LPL with atherogenesis. In medium and large arteries LPL is found on the luminal endothelial surface and in macrophage-rich areas within the plaque. LPL actions in both of these locations probably have major effects on the biology of the blood vessel. Possible atherogenic actions for this LPL based on in vitro experiments are reviewed.},

Elevated TG levels may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease, and studies suggest that mutations in the HL gene may be associated with elevated TG levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease. Hepatic lipase facilitates the clearance of TG from the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) pool, and this function is governed by the composition and quality of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. In humans, HL is a liver resident enzyme regulated by factors that release it from the liver and activate it in the bloodstream. HDL regulates the release of HL from the liver and HDL structure controls HL transport and activation in the circulation. Alterations in HDL-apolipoprotein composition can perturb HL function by inhibiting the release and activation of the enzyme. HDL structure may therefore affect plasma TG levels and coronary heart disease risk.},

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and hepatic lipase (HL) are important proteins that modulate the metabolism of HDL. Thus, the effect of thyroid hormone on the activities of CETP and of HL was investigated using hypothyroid and hyperthyroid CETP transgenic (Tg) and nontransgenic (nTg) mice. Hyperthyroid Tg mice plasma lipoprotein (LP) profile analysis showed a significant increase in the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction (P {\textless}.001) and decrease in the HDL fraction (P {\textless}.005), whereas in the hypothyroid Tg mice an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was observed (P {\textless}.02). CETP activity was measured as the transfer of (14)C-cholesteryl ester (CE) from labeled HDL to LDL by an isotopic assay indicative of mass. Hyperthyroid Tg mice had twice as much plasma CETP activity as compared with their controls, while in hypothyroid Tg mice plasma CETP activity did not change. The role of CETP in determining the changes in LP profile of hyperthyroid animals was confirmed by showing that nTg wild-type hyperthyroid and euthyroid mice exhibited the same percent cholesterol distribution in LP. Postheparin HL activity measured in hyperthyroid Tg mice was significantly reduced (P {\textless}.05). (3)H-cholesteryl oleoyl ether ((3)H-Cet)-HDL plasma fractional removal rate (FRR) was approximately 2-fold faster in the hyperthyroid Tg mice than in controls, but was not modified in hypothyroid animals. Tissue uptake of (3)H-Cet was examined in 10 tissue samples: levels were significantly increased in skeletal muscle and decreased in small intestine in hyperthyroid Tg mice, and decreased in the small intestine of hypothyroid Tg mice. In conclusion, the excess of thyroid hormone accelerates HDL metabolism in CETP transgenic mice mainly due to an increase in plasma CETP activity and independently from the HL activity. Hypothyroid status did not change CETP activity and HDL metabolism.},

	abstract = {Thyroid dysfunction is associated with multiple changes in lipoprotein metabolism, and we have determined the effects of thyroid dysfunction on plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. CETP is a plasma protein that mediates the exchange of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between plasma lipoproteins and plays an important role in high-density lipoprotein metabolism and in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Plasma CETP activity was assayed in 18 hyperthyroid and in 17 hypothyroid patients, before and after treatment, by measuring the transfer of cholesteryl esters from exogenous radiolabeled high-density lipoprotein to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Plasma CETP activity was increased in hyperthyroid patients, compared with their matched controls (22.11 +/- 8.92\% transferred/5 microL.4 h vs. 16.75 +/- 6.48, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas in hypothyroid patients, plasma CETP activity was decreased (11.14 +/- 4.84\% transferred/5 microL.4 h vs. 17.26 +/- 7.13, P {\textless} 0.01). Plasma CETP activity decreased after treatment of thyrotoxicosis, although a significant change was observed, mainly in the severely thyrotoxic patients with free T4 {\textgreater} 100 pmol/L (n = 11, 25.61 +/- 8.12\% transferred/5 microL.4 h vs. 21.71 +/- 7.84, P {\textless} 0.05).

There was a strong positive correlation between log(free T4) and plasma CETP activity (r = 0.51, P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review is intended to summarize the genetic studies published during the last 3 years that help us understand the physiology of apoAV and its clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS APOA5 is probably the gene with the strongest effect on triglyceride (TG) metabolism. APOA5 is almost exclusively expressed in the liver, and its product apoAV has a very low circulating concentration. New physiological roles of apoAV have been recently elucidated, such as control of chylomicron production in the intestine and TG accumulation in adipose tissue. The key role of APOA5 in TG metabolism has been largely shown through genetic studies in association with either severe or moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Studies suggest that APOA5 variants affect not only total TG concentrations but also the entire lipoprotein subclass distribution, shifting them toward atherogenic dyslipidemia in high-risk subjects. Environmental interactions and epigenetic factors are also crucial in regulating these processes. Delineation of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional control of the gene, combined with determination of biological significance of the SNPs in the APOA5 locus, would help to fully understand the effect of APOA5 on TGs. In summary, APOA5 variants cause hypertriglyceridemia. In high cardiovascular risk patients (e.g., patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes), APOA5 variants elevate TG levels and shift the entire lipoprotein subclass distribution toward atherogenic dyslipidemia. At a physiological level, apoAV seems to encompass more roles than those initially suggested after its discovery.},

	abstract = {The apolipoprotein AV gene (APOA5) is a key determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and a biomarker for the metabolic syndrome. Since thyroid hormones influence very low density lipoprotein triglyceride metabolism and clinical studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between thyroid status and plasma triglyceride levels, we examined whether APOA5 is regulated by thyroid hormone. Here we report that 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and a synthetic thyroid receptor beta (TRbeta) ligand increase APOA5 mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes. Our data revealed that T3-activated TR directly regulates APOA5 promoter through a functional direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4). Interestingly, we show that upstream stimulatory factor 1, a transcription factor associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia and elevated triglyceride levels in humans, and upstream stimulatory factor 2 cooperate with TR, resulting in a synergistic activation of APOA5 promoter in a ligand-dependent manner via an adjacent E-box motif. In rats, we observed that apoAV levels declines with thyroid hormone depletion but returned to normal levels upon T3 administration. In addition, treatments with a TRbeta-selective agonist increased apoAV and diminished triglyceride levels. The identification of APOA5 as a T3 target gene provides a new potential mechanism whereby thyroid hormones can influence triglyceride homeostasis. Additionally, these data suggest that TRbeta may be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.},

A majority of LPL deficient patients have been reported to have point mutations in the LPL gene; however, we find a complex deletion-insertion mutation by Alu elements, mobile retrotransposons, in a patient with LPL deficiency. This patient suffered from acute pancreatitis, showed chylomicronemia and lacked detectable LPL activity or mass in her postheparin plasma. Southern blot analysis and long-range PCR of the patient's DNA demonstrated a 2.2-kb deletion encompassing exon 2. Sequence analysis revealed (1) a 2.3-kb deletion between an AT-rich region adjacent to an Alu element in intron 1 and another Alu element in intron 2; (2) an insertion of approximately 150bp 5'-truncated Alu sequence with a poly (A) tail at the deletion point. The inserted sequence belongs to Alu Yb9, the youngest subfamily of Alu elements. The deletion occurred at the consensus cleavage site (3'-A{\textbar}TTTT-5') without target site duplication. These findings indicated that Alu retrotransposition caused the complex deletion-insertion. The patient was homozygous for this complex mutation, which eliminates exon 2 and leads to LPL deficiency. To our knowledge, the patient is the first case with LPL deficiency due to a complex deletion-insertion mediated by Alu repetitive elements.},

KK/San mice show low plasma lipid levels compared with wild-type KK mice despite showing signs of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Recently, we identified a mutation in the gene encoding angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3) in KK/San mice, and injection of adenoviruses encoding Angptl3 or recombinant ANGPTL3 protein to mutant KK/San mice raised plasma lipid levels. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of ANGPTL3 on lipid metabolism, we focused on the metabolic pathways of triglyceride in the present study. Overexpression of Angptl3 in KK/San mice resulted in a marked increase of triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). In vivo studies using Triton WR1339 revealed that there is no significant difference between mutant and wild-type KK mice in the hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion rate. However, turnover studies using radiolabeled VLDL revealed that the clearance of (3)H-triglyceride-labeled VLDL was significantly enhanced in KK/San mice, whereas the clearance of (125)I-labeled VLDL was only slightly enhanced. In vitro analysis of recombinant protein revealed that ANGPTL3 directly inhibits LPL activity. These data strongly support the hypothesis that ANGPTL3 is a new class of lipid metabolism modulator, which regulates VLDL triglyceride levels through the inhibition of LPL activity.},

	abstract = {Whereas the role of thyroid hormone is clearly established in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, its involvement in the control of serum triglyceride (TG) levels remains largely debated. Angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4 have recently been characterized as potent lipoprotein lipase inhibitors and therefore as important components of plasma triglyceride homeostasis. In the present study, the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of both ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL3 gene expression was investigated. In vivo studies revealed that thyroid hormone down-regulates ANGPTL3 but not ANGPTL4 gene expression in hypothyroid rats. Using thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-deficient mice, we show that thyroid hormone regulates ANGPTL3 gene expression in a TRbeta-dependent manner. Transfection studies revealed that this inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level in a DNA binding-independent fashion and requires the proximal (-171 to +66) region of the ANGPTL3 gene promoter. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the HNF1 site within this proximal region mediates this TRbeta-dependent repression. Finally, co-transfection studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that TRbeta antagonizes the HNF1alpha signaling pathway by inhibiting its transcriptional activity without interfering with its DNA-binding capacity. Taken together, our results lead to the identification of ANGPTL3 as a novel TRbeta target gene and provide a new potential mechanism to explain the hypotriglyceridemic properties of TRbeta agonists in vivo.},

We studied 42 subjects with slight to moderate elevations of circulating TSH and normal free thyroid hormone levels in whom the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease had been excluded using the best of the currently available laboratory and instrumental techniques. In three families (A, B, and C), which included 8 of the 42 cases, other members besides the propositus were found to have isolated hyperthyrotropinemia. The entire coding regions of the TSH receptor (TSHr) gene were sequenced, and TSHr mutations were found in five subjects from families A and B. No mutations were identified in the two members of family C, in one member of family A, and in the 34 remaining cases of isolated hyperthyrotropinemia. A previously described P162A mutation was found in the proband (homozygous state), the son, and the mother of family A (both in the heterozygous state). A new inactivating heterozygous mutation was found in the proband and the mother of family B and consisted of the substitution of a leucine in place of a highly conserved proline at position 252 (L252P) in the extracellular portion of the TSHr. After transfection in COS-7 cells, the mutant L252P displayed a low expression at the cell surface and a reduced response to bovine TSH in terms of cAMP production. A structural defect of the mutant TSHr protein was probably responsible for the poor routing of the receptor to the cell membrane. In conclusion, in two of three families, but in none of 34 sporadic cases of isolated hyperthyrotropinemia, inactivating mutations of the TSHr were identified. The question of whether the latter cases represent subtle forms of autoimmune thyroiditis or might bear as yet unidentified genetic defects remains a matter of future studies.},

	abstract = {The composition and the transport of lipoproteins are seriously disturbed in thyroid diseases. Overt hypothyroidism is characterized by hypercholesterolaemia and a marked increase in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and apolipoprotein B (apo A) because of a decreased fractional clearance of LDL by a reduced number of LDL receptors in the liver. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are normal or even elevated in severe hypothyroidism because of decreased activity of cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) and hepatic lipase (HL), which are enzymes regulated by thyroid hormones. The low activity of CETP, and more specifically of HL, results in reduced transport of cholesteryl esters from HDL(2) to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate low-density lipoprotein (IDL), and reduced transport of HDL(2) to HDL(3). Moreover, hypothyroidism increases the oxidation of plasma cholesterol mainly because of an altered pattern of binding and to the increased levels of cholesterol, which presents a substrate for the oxidative stress. Cardiac oxygen consumption is reduced in hypothyroidism. This reduction is associated with increased peripheral resistance and reduced contractility. Hypothyroidism is often accompanied by diastolic hypertension that, in conjunction with the dyslipidemia, may promote atherosclerosis. However, thyroxine therapy, in a thyrotropin (TSH)-suppressive dose, usually leads to a considerable improvement of the lipid profile. The changes in lipoproteins are correlated with changes in free thyroxine (FT(4)) levels. Hyperthyroidism exhibits an enhanced excretion of cholesterol and an increased turnover of LDL resulting in a decrease of total and LDL cholesterol, whereas HDL are decreased or not affected. The action of thyroid hormone on Lp(a) lipoprotein is still debated, because both decrease or no changes have been reported. The discrepancies are mostly because of genetic polymorphism of apo(a) and to the differences between the various study groups. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is associated with lipid disorders that are characterized by normal or slightly elevated total cholesterol levels, increased LDL, and lower HDL. Moreover, SH has been associated with endothelium dysfunction, aortic atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. Lipid disorders exhibit great individual variability. Nevertheless, they might be a link, although it has not been proved, between SH and atherosclerosis.},

In parallel with serum T3 (S-T3) concentrations increasing from low in hypothyroidism to high in hyperthyroidism there were gradually higher HL activities over the full spectrum of thyroid function, accompanied by decreasing levels of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was lower (P less than 0.05) in hyperthyroidism than in euthyroidism but not significantly changed in the hypothyroid groups. HL was correlated to S-T3 (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol to log S-T3 (r = -0.76, P less than 0.001), and LDL cholesterol to log HL (r = -0.55, P less than 0.001). The activity of LPL was decreased (P less than 0.001) in overt hypothyroidism compared to euthyroidism but, in contrast to HL, the activity of LPL was not increased in hyperthyroidism. The plasma triglyceride (P-TG) concentration was elevated (P less than 0.01) in overt hypothyroidism but not significantly changed in subclinical hypothyroidism or in hyperthyroidism. The LPL activity was correlated to log S-T3 (r = 0.45, P less than 0.001), P-TG to log S-T3 (r = -0.37, P less than 0.01) and P-TG to log LPL activity (r = -0.71, P less than 0.001). Our results demonstrate that thyroid hormones influence HL and LPL activities in different ways, suggesting different mechanisms of action. Changes in HL activity seem to be an important mechanism for the disturbance of cholesterol metabolism in thyroid dysfunction while the thyroid hormone influence on LPL seems to be of importance mainly for the disturbance in triglyceride metabolism.},

Conceptually, defects leading to RTSH impair both aspects of TSH-mediated action, namely thyroid hormone synthesis and gland growth.

	abstract = {Relevant English language articles published from 1970 through 1993 regarding the possible influence of cigarette smoking on the thyroid were identified through a MEDLINE search and manual searches of identified articles. Thiocyanate in tobacco smoke influences the thyroid by a competitive inhibition of iodine uptake and organification in the gland. Also the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system by cigarette smoke and benzpyrene, another constituent of tobacco, is thought to influence thyroid gland function. The thyroid hormones and TSH receptor autoantibodies are not affected by smoking, but serum TSH levels have been found to be slightly reduced. Smokers have a higher frequency of goiter and increased serum thyroglobulin levels, especially in iodine-deficient areas. Graves' ophthalmopathy is strongly associated with cigarette smoking; the more severe the eye disease the stronger the association. Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy is also associated with smoking, though this association is weaker. Thiocyanate level in cord blood equilibrates completely with the level in the mother, and a reverse correlation has been demonstrated between birth weight and thiocyanate level in cord blood. Cigarette smoking induces similar changes in thyroid function in the adult and the fetus. No separate study has elucidated the effects of cessation of smoking, but there seems to be longstanding effects induced by smoking, some probably irreversible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Information on determinants and change of thyroid function over time is sparse and conflicting but crucial for clinical interpretation and research. Therefore, our aim was to systematically investigate determinants of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) (as markers of thyroid function), their mutual relation (as marker of thyroid function set point) and changes in thyroid function over time. METHODS We included 9402 participants from the Rotterdam Study not taking thyroid medication and with available thyroid function measurements. Repeated measurements (6.5-year interval) were available for 1225 participants. The association of selected determinants with TSH, FT4, and their mutual relation (reflecting thyroid function set point) was estimated using linear regression models using restricted cubic splines with three knots. The factors investigated were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking, alcohol use, thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb), and common genetic factors. RESULTS Most influential determinants of TSH were age, smoking, genetic determinants, and TPOAb levels (p {\textless} 0.001). For FT4, most influential determinants were age, BMI, sex, genetic determinants and TPOAb levels (p {\textless} 0.001). Older age, female sex, and increased TPOAb levels were associated with a stronger relation between TSH and FT4. TSH levels did not change over time, irrespective of age. FT4 levels increased over time, most prominently in those older than 65 years of age (mean increase of 4.5 pmol/L). CONCLUSIONS The main factors that influence the relationship between thyroid hormone and molar concentrations of TSH in our population-based cohort study are age, smoking, BMI, TPOAb levels, and common genetic variants. The set point that determines TSH secretion as it relates to negative thyroid hormone feedback is modified by age, sex and TPOAb positivity. FT4 levels increase over time, with a more pronounced increase in the elderly, while TSH values seem stable over time. Our results question the current notion of an increase of TSH with increasing age.},

	abstract = {Reference intervals serve as the basis of laboratory testing and aid the physician in differentiating between the healthy and diseased patient. Standard methods for determining the reference interval are to define and obtain a healthy population of at least 120 individuals and use nonparametric estimates of the 95\% reference interval. This method is less accurate if the group size is significantly less and does not allow for exclusion of outliers. In order to overcome these limitations many authors in the current literature report reference intervals after arbitrary truncation of the data or use inappropriate parametric calculations. We argue that the use of outlier removal and robust estimators, with or without transformation to normality, address the shortcomings of the standard method and eliminate the need for employing less valid methods.To test these methods of analysis well-defined test groups are required. In a few studies physician-determined health status is provided for each subject along with commonly measured analytes. The NHANES and Fernald studies provide such groups. With such data it is possible to show the range of effects on the reference interval width by including a known non-healthy subgroup. With the NHANES data the effect ranged from negligible to a 30\% increase in reference interval width. We found that use of outlier detection with the robust estimator yielded reference intervals that were closer to those of the true healthy group.Another issue is one of demographics. That is, whether or not one should derive separate reference intervals for different demographic groups, e.g., males and females. The standard mathematical test for deriving separate reference intervals is due to Harris and Boyd. Using the NHANES data we examined 33 analytes for each of three ethnic groups (separated by genders). We used the Harris and Boyd procedure and observed that it was necessary to derive separate reference intervals for approximately 30\% of the comparisons. The most notable analytes were glucose and gamma GT.The methods used by most laboratories have similar precision, identical units, are linearly related (often on a 1:1 basis) and correlate well with each other. As a result the only difference is the method bias. By using the reference interval width, this bias is eliminated. We argue that the log ratio of the reference interval widths is a good estimate of the variability between groups.},

Patients with mutations in THRB present with resistance to thyroid hormone β (RTHβ), which is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormone, normal or elevated levels of TSH and goitre. Mechanistic insights about the contributions of THRβ to various processes, including colour vision, development of the cochlea and the cerebellum, and normal functioning of the adult liver and heart, have been obtained by either introducing human THRB mutations into mice or by deletion of the mouse Thrb gene. The introduction of the same mutations that mimic human THRβ alterations into the mouse Thra and Thrb genes resulted in distinct phenotypes, which suggests that THRA and THRB might have non-overlapping functions in human physiology. These studies also suggested that THRA mutations might not be lethal. Seven patients with mutations in THRα have since been described. These patients have RTHα and presented with major abnormalities in growth and gastrointestinal function. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in these individuals is minimally affected, which suggests that the central T3 feedback loop is not impaired in patients with RTHα, in stark contrast to patients with RTHβ.},

To evaluate the respective contribution of thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha1 and beta in this regulation, the responses to 2\% dietary cholesterol and T3 were studied in TRalpha1 and TRbeta knockout mice under hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions. Our experiments show that the normal stimulation in CYP7A activity and mRNA level by T3 is lost in TRbeta-/- but not in TRalpha1-/-mice, identifying TRbeta as the mediator of T3 action on CYP7A and, consequently, as a major regulator of cholesterol metabolism in vivo. Somewhat unexpectedly, T3-deficient TRbeta-/- mice showed an augmented CYP7A response after challenge with dietary cholesterol, and these animals did not develop hypercholesterolemia to the extent as did wild-type (wt) controls. The latter results lend strong support to the concept that TRs may exert regulatory effects in vivo independent of T3.},

Despite these findings, there is no readily apparent pathology due to CT excess or deficiency and there is no evidence that circulating CT is of substantial benefit to any mammal. Mammalian CT at physiological doses is not essential and very likely the CT gene has survived because of the gene's alternate mRNA pathway to produce calcitonin-gene-related peptide found in neural tissues. CT is not involved in calcium homeostasis or any other important physiological function, except, possibly, as an adjunct to protection of the skeleton under conditions of calcium stress, and appears to be in the process of becoming vestigial. CT produced in other tissues has paracrine actions that modulate functions such as proton transport, acid-base balance, prolactin secretion, and gastrointestinal motility. C-cells in mammals evolved from the ultimobranchial body that secretes CT in all lower vertebrates. It is highly probable that changes in amino acid sequence during evolution are responsible for the loss of activity, as fish CT is about 40 times as potent as human CT. CT may have been very important to survival in seawater fish, but the presence of the parathyroid gland and other evolutionary changes occurring in tetrapods suggest that the function of CT is no longer important.},

	abstract = {Calcitonin is a 32 amino acid hormone secreted by the C-cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin has been preserved during the transition from ocean-based life to land dwellers and is phylogenetically older than parathyroid hormone. Calcitonin secretion is stimulated by increases in the serum calcium concentration and calcitonin protects against the development of hypercalcemia. Calcitonin is also stimulated by gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin. This has led to the unproven hypothesis that postprandial calcitonin stimulation could play a role in the deposition of calcium and phosphate in bone after feeding. However, no bone or other abnormalities have been described in states of calcitonin deficiency or excess except for diarrhea in a few patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Calcitonin is known to stimulate renal 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D (1,25D) production at a site in the proximal tubule different from parathyroid hormone and hypophosphatemia. During pregnancy and lactation, both calcitonin and 1,25D are increased. The increases in calcitonin and 1,25D may be important in the transfer of maternal calcium to the fetus/infant and in the prevention and recovery of maternal bone loss. Calcitonin has an immediate effect on decreasing osteoclast activity and has been used for treatment of hypercalcemia. Recent studies in the calcitonin gene knockout mouse have shown increases in bone mass and bone formation. This last result together with the presence of calcitonin receptors on the osteocyte suggests that calcitonin could possibly affect osteocyte products which affect bone formation. In summary, a precise role for calcitonin remains elusive more than 50 years after its discovery.},

	abstract = {Central hyperthyroidism is a rare condition in which thyrotoxicosis results from primary overproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland with subsequent thyroid enlargement and hyperfunction. The two known causes of central hyperthyroidism are TSH-producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) and the syndrome of PRTH. Both of these entities are characterized by clinical thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiters, elevated circulating levels of free T4 and T3, and a nonsupressed serum TSH. It is critical to distinguish central hyperthyroidism from the much more common types of primary hyperthyroidism, all of which have undetectable TSH values. TSHomas and PRTH can usually be differentiated from one another by measuring the serum alpha-subunit and the TSH response to intravenous TRH or exogenous thyroid hormone, and by pituitary imaging studies. TSHomas are usually benign adenomas arising from the monoclonal expansion of neoplastic thyrotropes. Causative oncogenes have not yet been convincingly identified. PRTH is a nonneoplastic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the gene for the thyroid hormone receptor beta; it is a poorly understoof variant of GRTH. For unclear reasons, in PRTH, the pituitary gland is resistant to the feedback inhibitory effects of circulating thyroid hormones while peripheral tissues respond normally, causing patients to experience the toxic peripheral effects of thyroid hormone excess. TSHomas are best treated by transphenoidal surgical removal. Radiotherapy is indicated for inoperable or incompletely resected tumors. Octreotide adminstration is a useful adjunct for preoperatively reducing tumor size and for the medical management of surgical treatment failures. PRTH is ideally treated by chronically suppressing TSH secretion with medications such as D-thyroxine, TRIAC, octreotide, or bromocriptine. If such therapy is ineffective or unavailable, thyroid ablation with radioiodine or surgery may be employed with subsequent close monitoring of both thyroid hormone status and pituitary gland size.},

METHODS We studied 2730 men and women, aged 70 to 79 years, with baseline thyrotropin (TSH) measurements and 4-year follow-up data to determine whether subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and cardiovascular-related and total mortality. After the exclusion of participants with abnormal thyroxine levels, subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level of 4.5 mIU/L or greater, and was further classified according to TSH levels (4.5-6.9, 7.0-9.9, and {\textgreater} or = 10.0 mIU/L). RESULTS Subclinical hypothyroidism was present in 338 (12.4\%) of the participants. Compared with euthyroid participants, CHF events occurred more frequently among those with a TSH level of 7.0 mIU/L or greater (35.0 vs 16.5 per 1000 person-years; P = .006), but not among those with TSH levels between 4.5 and 6.9 mIU/L. In multivariate analyses, the risk of CHF was higher among those with high TSH levels (TSH of 7.0-9.9 mIU/L: hazard ratio, 2.58 [95\% confidence interval, 1.19-5.60]; and TSH of {\textgreater} or = 10.0 mIU/L: hazard ratio, 3.26 [95\% confidence interval, 1.37-7.77]). Among the 2555 participants without CHF at baseline, the hazard ratio for incident CHF events was 2.33 (95\% confidence interval, 1.10-4.96; P = .03) in those with a TSH of 7.0 mIU/L or greater. Subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, or cardiovascular-related or total mortality. CONCLUSIONS Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of CHF among older adults with a TSH level of 7.0 mIU/L or greater, but not with other cardiovascular events and mortality.

The average increase in systolic blood pressure was 2.0 mm Hg [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.6 mm Hg] per milliunit per liter increase in TSH among men, and 1.8 mm Hg (95\% CI 1.4-2.3 mm Hg) in women. The corresponding increase in diastolic blood pressure was 1.6 mm Hg (95\% CI 1.2-2.0 mm Hg) in men and 1.1 mm Hg (95\% CI 0.8-1.3 mm Hg) in women. Comparing TSH of 3.0-3.5 mU/liter (upper part of the reference) with TSH of 0.50-0.99 mU/liter (lower part of the reference), the odds ratio for hypertension was 1.98 (95\% CI 1.56-2.53) in men and 1.23 (95\% CI 1.04-1.46) in women.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Within the reference range of TSH, we found a linear positive association between TSH and systolic and diastolic blood pressure that may have long-term implications for cardiovascular health.},

	abstract = {Although subclinical hypothyroidism is frequently diagnosed, the decision to institute a substitutive therapy with L-T4 remains controversial. Because the cardiovascular system is considered a main target for the action of thyroid hormone, we investigated whether subclinical hypothyroidism induces cardiovascular abnormalities. Twenty-six patients (mean age, 36 +/- 12 yr) were evaluated by Doppler-echocardiography, whereas a subgroup of 10 patients, randomly selected, were reevaluated after 6 months of L-T4 substitutive therapy (mean dose, 68 microg daily). Thirty subjects (matched for age, sex, and body surface area) served as controls. Mean plasma TSH was significantly higher in patients (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas mean serum free T4 and free T3 concentrations, although in the normal range, were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.005, respectively). Blood pressure and heart rate did not differ from control values. Echocardiogram examination showed no abnormalities of the left ventricular morphology and a slight, but not significant, reduction in the systolic function in the patient group. In contrast, Doppler-derived indices of diastolic function showed significant prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time (94 +/- 13 vs. 84 +/- 8 msec; P {\textless} 0.001), increased A wave (55 +/- 13 vs. 48 +/- 9 cm/sec; P {\textless} 0.05), and reduced early diastolic mitral flow velocity/late diastolic mitral flow velocity ratio (1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.3; P {\textless} 0.001). In the subgroup of 10 patients, thyroid hormone profile was normalized by 6 months of L-T4 substitutive therapy, whereas no changes were observed in the left ventricular morphology. Systolic function was significantly enhanced, as compared with pretreatment values (P {\textless} 0.01) but did not differ from control values. Also, systemic vascular resistance was significantly decreased by L-T4 replacement therapy. Assessment of diastolic function showed significant shortening of isovolumic relaxation time (77 +/- 15 vs. 91 +/- 8; P {\textless} 0.05), reduction of A wave (51 +/- 13 vs. 60 +/- 12; P {\textless} 0.01), and increase of early diastolic mitral flow velocity/late diastolic mitral flow velocity ratio (1.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3; P {\textless} 0.001). These indices, however, were comparable with those of control subjects. These findings indicate that subclinical hypothyroidism affects diastolic function and that this abnormality may be reversed by L-T4 substitutive therapy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The objective was to determine the risk of stroke associated with subclinical hypothyroidism. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Published prospective cohort studies were identified through a systematic search through November 2013 without restrictions in several databases. Unpublished studies were identified through the Thyroid Studies Collaboration. We collected individual participant data on thyroid function and stroke outcome. Euthyroidism was defined as TSH levels of 0.45-4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as TSH levels of 4.5-19.9 mIU/L with normal T4 levels. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We collected individual participant data on 47 573 adults (3451 subclinical hypothyroidism) from 17 cohorts and followed up from 1972-2014 (489 192 person-years). Age- and sex-adjusted pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for participants with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to euthyroidism were 1.05 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.21) for stroke events (combined fatal and nonfatal stroke) and 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.80-1.42) for fatal stroke. Stratified by age, the HR for stroke events was 3.32 (95\% CI, 1.25-8.80) for individuals aged 18-49 years. There was an increased risk of fatal stroke in the age groups 18-49 and 50-64 years, with a HR of 4.22 (95\% CI, 1.08-16.55) and 2.86 (95\% CI, 1.31-6.26), respectively (p trend 0.04). We found no increased risk for those 65-79 years old (HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.18) or ≥ 80 years old (HR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.79-2.18). There was a pattern of increased risk of fatal stroke with higher TSH concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Although no overall effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on stroke could be demonstrated, an increased risk in subjects younger than 65 years and those with higher TSH concentrations was observed.},

	abstract = {Despite their specific functional consequences, radiotherapy-induced thyroid abnormalities remain under-estimated and underreported. These sequelae may include primary or central hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, Graves' disease, euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy, benign adenomas, multinodular goitre and radiation-induced thyroid carcinoma. Primary hypothyroidism, the most common radiation-induced thyroid dysfunction, affects 20-30\% of patients administered following curative radiotherapy to the neck region, with approximately half of the events occurring within the first 5 years after therapy. The relative risk of radiation-induced cancer (mainly well-differentiated tumours) is 15-53-fold higher than in non-irradiated population. The aetiology of radiation-induced thyroid injury includes vascular damage, parenchymal cell damage and auto-immune reactions. Total radiotherapy dose, irradiated volume of the thyroid gland, and the extent of prior thyroid resection are among the most important factors associated with the risk of hypothyroidism. The contribution of other treatment modalities (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy) as well as patient- and tumour-related factors is less clear. Reduction in radiation dose to the thyroid gland and hypothalamic/pituitary complex should be attempted whenever possible. New radiotherapy techniques, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, three-dimensional conformal irradiation, intensity modulated radiotherapy and proton therapy allow generally better dose distribution with lower dose to the non-target organs. The diagnostic approach to thyroid radiation injury includes baseline thyroid function assays in all patients undergoing thyroid or parasellar irradiation. Recommended follow-up procedures include at least annual evaluation with a history for symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, clinical examination, and measurement of thyroid hormones and thyrotropin. Management of overt hypothyroidism is based on hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid hormone therapy is also recommended in cases of subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment of her radiation-induced thyroid disorders (thyroiditis, Graves' disease, thyroid cancer) is similar to that employed in spontaneously occurring conditions. Further improvements in radiotherapy techniques and progress in endocrine diagnostics and therapy may allow better prevention and management of radiation-related thyroid injury. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The thyroid gland is the largest pure endocrine gland in the body and one of the organs most likely to produce clinically significant abnormalities after therapeutic external radiation. Radiation doses to the thyroid that exceed approximately 26 Gy frequently produce hypothyroidism, which may be clinically overt or subclinical, as manifested by increased serum thyrotropin and normal serum-free thyroxine concentrations. Pituitary or hypothalamic hypothyroidism may arise when the pituitary region receives doses exceeding 50 Gy with conventional, 1.8-2 Gy fractionation. Direct irradiation of the thyroid may increase the risk of Graves' disease or euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy. Silent thyroiditis, cystic degeneration, benign adenoma, and thyroid cancer have been observed after therapeutically relevant doses of external radiation. Direct or incidental thyroid irradiation increases the risk for well-differentiated, papillary, and follicular thyroid cancer from 15- to 53-fold. Thyroid cancer risk is highest following radiation at a young age, decreases with increasing age at treatment, and increases with follow-up duration. The potentially prolonged latent period between radiation exposure and the development of thyroid dysfunction, thyroid nodularity, and thyroid cancer means that individuals who have received neck or pituitary irradiation require careful, periodic clinical and laboratory evaluation to avoid excess morbidity. © 1995.},

Seven hundred twenty-six patients underwent baseline thyroid function screening and were assessed for presence of clinical thyroid disease. Serum thyrotropin level (TSH) was measured in 707 patients (97\%), and thyroxine level (T4) in 407 patients (56\%).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A TSH level less than 0.1 mU/L was present in 5 patients (0.7\%). A TSH level less than normal but more than 0.1 mU/L was present in 34 patients (4.7\%). No patient had definite hypothyroidism (TSH {\textgreater} 20 mU/L), but 56 patients (7.7\%) had an elevated TSH level that was less than 20 mU/L. During 1.7 years of follow-up, only 7 patients were found to have clinical hyperthyroidism, and 11 patients (1.5\%) had hypothyroidism. Logistic regression analysis showed that palpitations (odds ratio, 4.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.7-14.0) and asymptomatic presentation (odds ratio, 5.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.9-16.2) were risk factors for low TSH level, and increasing age (odds ratio, 1.32 every 10 years; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.66) was a risk factor for high TSH level. The positive predictive value of palpitations and asymptomatic presentation for low TSH level were 9\% and 8\%, respectively.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: An abnormal TSH level is common in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation. However, clinical thyroid disease is uncommon. Routine TSH screening of patients who have atrial fibrillation has a low yield and may be better applied to those patients at higher risk of having undiagnosed clinical thyroid disease.},

OBJECTIVE We report an analysis of TSH distribution in a population with no evidence of thyroid disease, including a normal thyroid ultrasound. DESIGN A subset of the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study cohort was used to examine the TSH distribution in a population having no evidence of thyroid disease, seronegative thyroid autoantibodies, no history of thyroid medications, and a normal thyroid ultrasound. The shape of the TSH distribution was compared with the Gaussian and lognormal distributions. SETTING This study was performed in the general community. PARTICIPANTS Of 1861 Hanford Thyroid Disease Study participants with TSH measured by ELISA who also had thyroid peroxidase antibody measurements, 766 comprised the normal reference group 3 (NRG-3) with no evidence of thyroid disease, including no positive antibodies and normal thyroid ultrasound. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE TSH was measured. RESULTS The TSH distribution in the NRG (NRG-3) was right skewed and followed an approximate lognormal distribution. The best estimates of the 97.5th percentile, the percentage above 2.5 microIU/ml, and the percentage above 3.0 microIU/ml for TSH by 3rd generation immunochemiluminometric assay are 4.1 microIU/ml, 20\% and 10.2\%, respectively. CONCLUSION These results indicate that the TSH reference range should be narrowed and support a value of approximately 4.0 as the upper-reference limit.},

	abstract = {Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95\% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.},

	abstract = {Hormonal substitution therapy has been extremely successful, with respect to morbidity and mortality, in the treatment of the major syndromes of endocrine insufficiency. However, many patients treated for endocrine insufficiencies still suffer from more or less vague complaints and a decreased quality of life. It is likely that these complaints are, at least in part, caused by intrinsic imperfections of hormone replacement strategies in mimicking normal hormone secretion. Unfortunately, these complaints are often difficult to assess by clinicometric or biochemical tests, because the effects of hormones in general, and thus of hormone replacement strategies in particular, are difficult to quantify at the tIssue level. Therefore, in clinical practice we rely mostly on plasma variables - 'plasma endocrinology' - which are a poor reflection of hormone action at the tIssue level. Appreciation of these intrinsic shortcomings of endocrine therapy is of utmost importance to prevent incorrect labelling of the complaints of many endocrine patients and to achieve further improvement in endocrine replacement strategies.},

	abstract = {Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.},

	abstract = {Clinically relevant interassay precision profiles for thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone; TSH) were constructed with human serum pools measured over 4-8 weeks by six immunometric assays, in at least two different reagent lots. Functional sensitivities (the concentration at which the interassay CV is {\textless} or = 20\%) were determined in four to eight clinical laboratories plus the respective manufacturer's laboratory. These studies revealed that the manufacturer's stated functional sensitivity limit is rarely duplicated in clinical practice. Loss of specificity (indicated by artifactually high values) was seen with some methods when used to measure certain unrefrigerated low-TSH sera. Measurement of TSH in four human serum pools (TSH {\textless} 0.05-0.25 mIU/L) by 16 different methods (each in at least eight UK or US laboratories) showed that some methods could not reliably distinguish subnormal from normal TSH values. Better pool rankings and fewer misclassifications of low-TSH sera as "normal" were seen with use of assays capable of "third-generation" functional sensitivity (0.01-0.02 mIU/L) than with assays with "second-generation" functional sensitivity (0.1-0.2 mIU/L). Because inter- and intramethod differences in functional sensitivity negatively impact the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of a TSH-centered thyroid-testing strategy, laboratories should independently establish an assay's functional sensitivity by a clinically relevant protocol. Moreover, manufacturers should assess functional sensitivity more realistically and improve the robustness of assays to ensure that their performance potential is consistently met in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION The aim of the present study was to investigate the reference intervals for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in healthy individuals with normal levels of serum free thyroxine (fT4) and without sonographic pathologies, and determine the effects of age, gender, and residence on the TSH reference intervals. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This research was a population-based study conducted in 70 regions. The random sampling method was used to select the 1095 subjects of the study among inhabitants aged 18 and above. Patients who had a previous history of thyroid disease and had been taking medication were excluded from the study as this may have affected their fT4 or TSH levels. In addition, subjects who had serum fT4 without a reference range and abnormal ultrasonography findings were also excluded. A total of 408 subjects were used for establishing the reference intervals for TSH. RESULTS The data for TSH in the study group were not normally distributed according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov index. The geometric mean was 1.62 mIU/L, the median was 1.40 mIU/L, and the 95\% reference intervals were 0.38-4.22 mIU/L. The median TSH level was higher in females compared to males (p {\textless} 0.05). In the female subjects 2.5th percentile of TSH was lower and 97.5th percentile was higher than those of males. The reference intervals of TSH were of lower values in subjects over 50 years old (p {\textless} 0.001). DISCUSSION Studies suggest that determination of the TSH reference intervals may differ due to environmental influences or due to age, gender, and race. It is suggested that the lower limit of normal TSH for the adult Turkish population would be 0.38 mIU/L and the upper limit similar to the traditional value of 4.2 mIU/L. If each clinician uses their population-specific reference interval for TSH, thyroid function abnormalities can be accurately estimated.},

	abstract = {Mild forms of hypothyroidism--subclinical hypothyroidism--have recently been discussed as being a risk factor for the development of overt thyroid dysfunction and for a number of clinical disorders. The diagnosis critically depends on the definition of the upper normal limit of serum TSH as, by definition, free thyroxine serum concentrations are normal. Cut-off levels of 4-5 mU TSH/l have been conventionally used to diagnose an elevated TSH serum concentration. Recent data from large population studies have suggested a much lower TSH cut-off with an upper limit of 2-2.5 mU/l but application of strict criteria for inclusion of subjects from the general population studies aiming at assessing TSH reference intervals (no personal or family history of thyroid disease, no thyroid antibodies and a normal thyroid on ultrasonography) did not result in an unequivocal upper limit of normal TSH at 2.0-2.5 mU/l. When summarizing the available evidence for lowered upper TSH cut-off values and their potential therapeutic implications there is presently insufficient justification to lower the upper normal limit of TSH and, for practical purposes, it is still recommended to maintain the TSH reference interval of 0.4-4.0 mU/l. Classifying subjects with a TSH value between 2 and 4 mU/l as abnormal, as well as intervening with thyroxine treatment in such subjects, is probably doing more harm than good.},

These data provide a reference for other studies of these analytes in the U.S. For the 16,533 people who did not report thyroid disease, goiter, or taking thyroid medications (disease-free population), we determined mean concentrations of TSH, T(4), TgAb, and TPOAb. A reference population of 13,344 people was selected from the disease-free population by excluding, in addition, those who were pregnant, taking androgens or estrogens, who had thyroid antibodies, or biochemical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The influence of demographics on TSH, T(4), and antibodies was examined. Hypothyroidism was found in 4.6\% of the U.S. population (0.3\% clinical and 4.3\% subclinical) and hyperthyroidism in 1.3\% (0.5\% clinical and 0.7\% subclinical). (Subclinical hypothyroidism is used in this paper to mean mild hypothyroidism, the term now preferred by the American Thyroid Association for the laboratory findings described.) For the disease-free population, mean serum TSH was 1.50 (95\% confidence interval, 1.46-1.54) mIU/liter, was higher in females than males, and higher in white non-Hispanics (whites) [1.57 (1.52-1.62) mIU/liter] than black non-Hispanics (blacks) [1.18 (1.14-1.21) mIU/liter] (P {\textless} 0.001) or Mexican Americans [1.43 (1.40-1.46) mIU/liter] (P {\textless} 0.001). TgAb were positive in 10.4 +/- 0.5\% and TPOAb, in 11.3 +/- 0.4\%; positive antibodies were more prevalent in women than men, increased with age, and TPOAb were less prevalent in blacks (4.5 +/- 0.3\%) than in whites (12.3 +/- 0.5\%) (P {\textless} 0.001). TPOAb were significantly associated with hypo or hyperthyroidism, but TgAb were not. Using the reference population, geometric mean TSH was 1.40 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter and increased with age, and was significantly lower in blacks (1.18 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) than whites (1.45 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P {\textless} 0.001) and Mexican Americans (1.37 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P {\textless} 0.001). Arithmetic mean total T(4) was 112.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter in the disease-free population and was consistently higher among Mexican Americans in all populations. In the reference population, mean total T(4) in Mexican Americans was (116.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter), significantly higher than whites (110.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) or blacks (109.4 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) (P {\textless} 0.0001). The difference persisted in all age groups. In summary, TSH and the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies are greater in females, increase with age, and are greater in whites and Mexican Americans than in blacks. TgAb alone in the absence of TPOAb is not significantly associated with thyroid disease. The lower prevalence of thyroid antibodies and lower TSH concentrations in blacks need more research to relate these findings to clinical status. A large proportion of the U.S. population unknowingly have laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, which supports the usefulness of screening for early detection.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the apoB/apoA-I ratio was superior to any of the cholesterol ratios - total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C - in predicting the risk of coronary disease. Moreover, we examined whether any lipids, lipoproteins or cholesterol ratios add significant predictive information beyond that provided by the apoB/apoA-I ratio. METHODS Plasma lipids, lipoproteins, apoB, and apoA-I were measured in 69,030 men and 57,168 women above 40 years of age. After a mean follow-up of 98 months, 1183 men and 560 women had died from a myocardial infarction in this prospective apolipoprotein-related mortality risk (AMORIS) study. RESULTS High apoB and a high apoB/apoA-I ratio were strongly related to increased coronary risk, while high apoA-I was inversely related to risk. The apoB/apoA-I ratio was superior to any of the cholesterol ratios in predicting risk. This advantage was most pronounced in subjects with LDL-C levels {\textless}3.6 mmol/l. Addition of lipids, lipoproteins or any cholesterol ratio to apoB/apoA-I in risk models did not further improve the strong predictive value of apoB/apoA-I. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the apoB/apoA-I ratio is at present the best single lipoprotein-related variable to quantitate coronary risk. Given the additional advantages apolipoproteins possess - fasting samples are not required, apoB/apoA-I is a better index of the adequacy of statin therapy than LDL-C, and the measurement of apoB and apoA-I are standardized, whereas LDL-C and HDL-C are not - there would appear to be considerable advantage to integrating apolipoproteins into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {We previously reported that putative nuclear receptors for thyroid hormone can be demonstrated by incubation of hormone either with intact GH(1) cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line, or with isolated GH(1) cell nuclei and rat liver nuclei in vitro. We characterized further the kinetics of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) binding and the biochemical properties of the nuclear receptor after extraction to a soluble form with 0.4 M KCl. In vitro binding of [(125)I]T3 and [(125)I]T4 with GH(1) cell and rat liver nuclear extract was examined at 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Equilibrium was attained within 5 min at 37 degrees C and 2 h at 0 degrees C. The binding activity from GH(1) cells was stable for at least 1 h at 37 degrees C and 10 days at - 20 degrees C. Chromatography on a weak carboxylic acid column and inactivation by trypsin and Pronase, but not by DNase or RNase, suggested that the putative receptor was a nonhistone protein. The estimated equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)) for hormone binding to the solubilized nuclear binding activity was 1.80 x 10(-10) M (T3) and 1.20 x 10(-9) M (T4) for GH(1) cells and 1.57 x 10(-10) M (T3) and 2.0 x 10(-9) M (T4) for rat liver. These K(d) values for T3 are virtually identical to those which we previously reported with isolated rat liver nuclei and GH(1) cell nuclei in vitro. The 10-fold greater affinity for T3 compared to T4 in the nuclear extract is also identical to that observed with intact GH(1) cells. In addition, the [(125)I]T3 and [(125)I]T4 high-affinity binding in the nuclear extract were inhibited by either nonradioactive T3 or T4, which suggests that the binding activity in nuclear extract was identical for T3 and T4. In contrast, the binding activity for T4 and T3 in GH(1) cell cytosol was markedly different from that observed with nuclear extract (K(d) values were 2.87 x 10(-10) M for T4 and 1.13 x 10(-9) M for T3). Our results indicate that nuclear receptors for T3 and T4 can be isolated in a soluble and stable form with no apparent change in hormonal affinity.

METHODS Serum TSH and free T4 concentrations were derived from 606 healthy, non-pregnant, 18-91-year-old Finns from the Nordic Reference Interval Project (NORIP) and the possible effects of age, sex and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) status were evaluated. RESULTS After excluding TPOAb-positive subjects and outliers, a reference population of 511 subjects was obtained. In the reference population, no statistically significant gender- or age-specific differences in mean TSH (1.55 ± 3.30 mU/L) or TSH reference intervals were observed.

After adjusting for sex, logistic regression showed a higher prevalence of AF in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism compared with euthyroid subjects (9.5\% vs 4.7\%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; P=.01). Median serum free T(4) concentration was higher in those with AF than in those without (1.14 ng/dL; interquartile range [IQR], 1.05-1.27 ng/dL [14.7 pmol/L; IQR, 13.5-16.4 pmol/L] vs 1.10 ng/dL; IQR, 1.00-1.22 ng/dL [14.2 pmol/L; IQR, 12.9-15.7 pmol/L]; P{\textless}.001), and higher in those with AF when analysis was limited to euthyroid subjects (1.13 ng/dL; IQR, 1.05-1.26 ng/dL [14.6 pmol/L; IQR, 13.5-16.2 pmol/L] vs 1.10 ng/dL; IQR, 1.01-1.21 ng/dL [14.2 pmol/L; IQR, 13.0-15.6 pmol/L]; P=.001). Logistic regression showed serum free T(4) concentration, increasing category of age, and male sex all to be independently associated with AF. Similar independent associations were observed when analysis was confined to euthyroid subjects with normal TSH values. CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical finding of subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with AF on resting electrocardiogram. Even in euthyroid subjects with normal serum TSH levels, serum free T(4) concentration is independently associated with AF.},

	abstract = {Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) includes hyperthyroid Graves disease, hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis, and subtle subclinical thyroid dysfunctions. AITD is caused by interactions between genetic and environmental predisposing factors and results in autoimmune deterioration. Data on polymorphisms in the AITD susceptibility genes, related environmental factors, and dysregulation of autoimmune processes have accumulated over time. Over the last decade, there has been progress in the clinical field of AITD with respect to the available diagnostic and therapeutic methods as well as clinical consensus. The updated clinical guidelines allow practitioners to identify the most reasonable and current approaches for proper management. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding the genetic and environmental pathogenic mechanisms underlying AITD and introduce the updated set of clinical guidelines for AITD management. We also discuss other aspects of the disease such as management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, use of levothyroxine plus levotriiodothyronine in the treatment of autoimmune hypothyroidism, risk assessment of long-standing antithyroid drug therapy in recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism, and future research needs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data suggest symptoms of hypothyroidism persist in 5-10\% of levothyroxine (L-T4)-treated hypothyroid patients with normal serum thyrotrophin (TSH). The use of L-T4 + liothyronine (L-T3) combination therapy in such patients is controversial. The ETA nominated a task force to review the topic and formulate guidelines in this area.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Task force members developed a list of relevant topics. Recommendations on each topic are based on a systematic literature search, discussions within the task force, and comments from the European Thyroid Association (ETA) membership at large.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS FOR PERSISTING SYMPTOMS INCLUDE: awareness of a chronic disease, presence of associated autoimmune diseases, thyroid autoimmunity per se, and inadequacy of L-T4 treatment to restore physiological thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in serum and tissues. There is insufficient evidence that L-T4 + L-T3 combination therapy is better than L-T4 monotherapy, and it is recommended that L-T4 monotherapy remains the standard treatment of hypothyroidism. L-T4 + L-T3 combination therapy might be considered as an experimental approach in compliant L-T4-treated hypothyroid patients who have persistent complaints despite serum TSH values within the reference range, provided they have previously received support to deal with the chronic nature of their disease, and associated autoimmune diseases have been excluded. Treatment should only be instituted by accredited internists/endocrinologists, and discontinued if no improvement is experienced after 3 months. It is suggested to start combination therapy in an L-T4/L-T3 dose ratio between 13:1 and 20:1 by weight (L-T4 once daily, and the daily L-T3 dose in two doses). Currently available combined preparations all have an L-T4/L-T3 dose ratio of less than 13:1, and are not recommended. Close monitoring is indicated, aiming not only to normalize serum TSH and free T4 but also normal serum free T4/free T3 ratios. Suggestions are made for further research.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: L-T4 + L-T3 combination therapy should be considered solely as an experimental treatment modality. The present guidelines are offered to enhance its safety and to counter its indiscriminate use.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To what extent persons with subclinical hyper- or hypothyroidism are more (or less) likely to die than euthyroid control subjects remains a matter of controversy.  METHODS:We searched electronic reference databases up to July 31, 2007. Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility. Cohort studies published in full that reported data on the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality from all causes in persons with subclinical thyroid dysfunction versus euthyroid controls were included.  RESULTS:Based on seven cohorts including 290 participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism, random-effects models estimated that the pooled HR for all-cause mortality was 1.41 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.79; P=0.004). Using the pooled HR and standard life-table methods applied to a US reference population, we estimated that a white US woman, when diagnosed with subclinical hyperthyroidism at age of 70, has an excess mortality of 1.5, 4.0, and 8.7\% at 2, 5, and 10 years respectively after diagnosis. Likewise, a white US man has an excess mortality of 2.3, 5.7, and 10.7\%. For the nine cohorts including 1580 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, observed heterogeneity (Q test P=0.006; I(2)=63\%) disappeared after pooling cohorts in predefined subgroups according to the presence or absence of a comorbid condition. In doing so, the pooled HR for all-cause mortality was 1.03 (95\% CI, 0.78-1.35; P=0.83) in cohorts from the community and 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.36-2.30; P\&lt;0.001) in cohorts of participants with comorbidities (P=0.014 for heterogeneity among study groups).  CONCLUSIONS:Individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism demonstrate a 41\% increase in relative mortality from all causes versus euthyroid control subjects. Mathematical modeling suggests that absolute excess mortality after diagnosis might depend on age, with an increase beyond the age of 60, especially in aging men. For patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, the relative risk of all-cause mortality is increased only in patients with comorbid conditions.},

Whether or not all persons with a low value for serum TSH can be considered subclinically hyperthyroid is uncertain, but the low serum TSH per se is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation and perhaps other cardiovascular disease. Screening all persons, even in the older age groups, for subclinical hyperthyroidism may not be justified in and of itself but such persons would likely be screened for subclinical hypothyroidism and so those with subclinical hyperthyroidism identified. There are no controlled trials that show the benefit of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism, thus therapy at present needs to be determined by clinical judgement, aided by monitoring the patient to see if the low serum TSH level persists and assessing the presence or absence of other determinants of therapy such as an elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration, a multinodular goiter, or the appearance of overt symptoms.},

Methods: A systemic search of the literature using Pubmed, Medline and Ovid online tool was performed to identify relevant studies. Amongst the clinical studies, crossectional study and studies with follow-up period ranging between 4 and 20??yr were identified (Walsh JP, Bremner AP, Bulsara MK, et al.

Prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in elderly people from one low serum thyrotropin result: a 10-year cohort study. Lancet 2001 Sep 15; 358 (9285):861-5). Results: Sub-clinical hypothyroidism: The pooled estimate of the relative risk of CHD revealed significant difference both at baseline [RR with 95\% CI: 1.533 (1.312-1.791), P {\textless} 0.05] and at follow-up [RR with 95\% CI: 1.188 (1.024-1.379), P {\textless} 0.05]. The relative risk of all-cause mortality at follow-up revealed no significant difference. However, the relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes at follow-up was significantly higher [RR with 95\% CI: 1.278 (1.023-1.597), P {\textless} 0.05]. Sub-clinical hyperthyroidism: The pooled estimate of the relative risk of CHD revealed no significant difference both at baseline [RR with 95\% CI: 1.156 (0.709-1.883)] and at follow-up [RR with 95\% CI: 1.207 (0.780-1.870)].The relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes at follow-up was also not significantly higher. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up. In addition, mortality from cardiovascular causes is significantly higher at follow-up. Sub-clinical hyperthyroidism is not associated with CHD or mortality from cardiovascular causes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Currently there is ongoing debate on whether subclinical and overt thyroid dysfunction may exert deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system with the consequence of increased mortality in affected individuals. We systematically review studies on the relation of thyroid dysfunction with all-cause and circulatory mortality questioning whether thyroid dysfunction is a causal factor for mortality. METHODS: Two investigators independently searched the MEDLINE database. All case-control and cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Studies on nonthyroidal illness or low-T3 syndrome and reports from highly selected populations were not considered. Risk estimates from studies with appropriate adjustment for confounders were metaanalyzed. RESULTS: Four among eight studies performed to investigate the association between hyperthyroidism and mortality revealed an increased risk of either all-cause or circulatory mortality. Only the minority of studies, however, adjusted analyses for relevant confounders besides age, sex, and race. Studies after radioiodine therapy were generally biased by indication. Findings from 11 studies that investigated the relation between hypothyroidism and mortality were highly discrepant and partly even mutually exclusive. Some of these discrepancies are explained by confounding and selection. CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence for a causal relation of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism with mortality is weak and should particularly not be used to decide whether patients with subclinical thyroid conditions should be treated. Very old individuals might represent an exception from this rule and may benefit from mildly reduced thyroid function, but this has to be substantiated by further research.},

Despite the abundance of ECG LVH criteria, their prognostic values have been compared in only a few studies, and little has been known about how sex modifies the prognostic value of LVH. We assessed the relationship between ECG LVH and incident cardiovascular events in the general population. METHODS Several ECG LVH criteria were measured in 3059 women and 2456 men participating in the Health 2000 Study - a national general population survey. Association between ECG LVH and cardiovascular events were analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS ECG LVH was more prevalent in women than in men when measured with Cornell-based criteria, but less prevalent or nondifferent when measured with other criteria. The association between ECG LVH and events showed higher hazard ratios for women than in men. Sex × LVH interaction terms were statistically significant in part of the LVH criteria. In adjusted Cox models, Sokolow-Lyon voltage performed the best. The composite of Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell voltage was statistically significantly associated with events in both sexes. CONCLUSION Sex affects both the prevalence rates and prognostic values of ECG LVH criteria in the general population, while showing higher prognostic value of ECG LVH in women than in men. For clinical use, the composite of the Sokolow-Lyon voltage and the Cornell voltage seems to be a good option.},

	abstract = {Purpose Our objective was to investigate whether selfreported obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), simple snoring, and various markers of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are associated with cardiovascular risk. Methods We examined a representative nationwide cohort of 5177 Finnish adults aged ≥30 years. The participants underwent measurement of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and answered SDB-related questions derived from the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, which were used to operationalize self-reported OSA. The primary end point was incidence of a cardiovascular event (cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or coronary interventions). Results During a median follow-up of 11.2 years and 52,910 person-years of follow-up, 634 participants suffered a cardiovascular event. In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, selfreported OSA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34; 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.73; p=0.03) was an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Self-reported simple snoring by itself was not associated with future cardiovascular events (HR 0.88 versus non-snorers, 95 \% CI 0.75–1.04, p=0.15). However, among snorers (n=3152), frequent breathing cessations (HR 2.19, 95 \% CI 1.26–3.81, p=0.006) and very loud and irregular snoring (HR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.31–2.54, p{\textless}0.001) were associated with cardiovascular risk. Conclusions Self-reported OSA and SDB-related snoring variables are associated with cardiovascular risk, whereas simple snoring is not. In clinical practice and in surveys, questions concerning only habitual snoring should be amended with questions focusing on respiratory pauses and snoring stertorousness, which can be used to estimate the risk of OSA and cardiovascular events.},

Results During the follow-up period of 7.7 ± 0.2 years, a total of 72 SCDs occurred (1.3\%), with an average yearly incidence rate of 0.17\% per year. Increased RWH, JWH, and TWH in left precordial leads (V4-V6) were univariately associated with SCD (P {\textless}.001 for each). When adjusted with standard clinical risk markers, JWH and TWH remained independent predictors of SCD. Increased TWH (≥102 μV) was associated with a 1.7-fold adjusted relative risk for SCD (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.9; P =.048) and increased JWH (≥123 μV) with a 2.0-fold adjusted relative risk for SCD (95\% CI 1.2-3.3; P =.006). When both TWH and JWH were above the threshold, the adjusted relative risk for SCD was 2.9-fold (95\% CI 1.5-5.7; P =.002). When RWH (≥470 μV), JWH, and TWH were all above the threshold, the adjusted relative risk for SCD was 3.2-fold (95\% CI 1.4-7.1; P =.009). Conclusion Second central moment analysis of standard resting 12-lead electrocardiographic morphology provides an ultrarapid means for the automated measurement of spatial RWH, JWH, and TWH, enabling analysis of high subject volumes and screening for SCD risk in the general population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Administrative registers, like hospital discharge registers and causes of death registers are used for the monitoring of disease incidences and in the follow-up studies. Obtaining reliable results requires that the diagnoses in these registers are correct and the coverage of the registers is high. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the Finnish hospital discharge registers and causes of death registers stroke diagnoses against the population-based FINSTROKE register. METHODS All first stroke events from the hospital discharge registers and causes of death registers from the areas covered by the FINSTROKE register were obtained for years 1993-1998 and linked to the FINSTROKE register. The sensitivity and positive predictive values were calculated. RESULTS A total of 3633 stroke events, 767 fatal and 2866 non-fatal strokes, were included in the registers. The sensitivity for all first stroke events was 85\%, for fatal strokes 86\% and for non-fatal strokes 85\%. The positive predictive values for all first strokes was 86\%, for fatal strokes 92\% and for non-fatal strokes 85\%. The sensitivity as well as the positive predictive values for subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage was higher than for cerebral infarctions. There were no marked differences in the sensitivity or positive predictive values between men and women. CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity and the positive predictive values of the Finnish hospital discharge registers and causes of death registers are fairly good. Finnish administrative registers can be used for the monitoring of stroke incidence, but the number of cerebral infarctions should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The recent introduction of sensitive markers of myocardial injury is likely to affect the epidemiology of coronary heart disease (CHD). The American Heart Association together with other societies and research agencies have recently published a new definition on acute CHD to improve consistency in epidemiological and clinical studies (referred here as the '2003 definition'). METHODS In this study we compare the data on CHD events in the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register (HDR) and the Causes of Death Register (CDR) with the population-based myocardial infarction (MI) register, FINMONICA/FINAMI. The FINMONICA/FINAMI events were classified according to the 2003 definition. The relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the HDR and CDR were used. RESULTS Using the 2003 definition as the reference, the overall sensitivity of the ICD codes for MI in the combined HDR and CDR was 83\% and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 90\%. When the ICD codes for unstable angina were added to the analyses, the sensitivity improved to 85\% and the PPV declined to 83\%. In the age group 35-74 the sensitivity of the MI codes improved over time, in men from 64\% in 1988-1992 to 81\% in 1998-2002, and in women from 61 to 78\%, respectively. The oldest age group, 75 years or older, had sensitivity and PPV values comparable to those of the younger. CONCLUSION Diagnoses of fatal and non-fatal CHD events in the Finnish HDR and Causes of Death register were reasonably valid indicators for hard CHD events when compared with the FINMONICA/FINAMI register data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for up to half of cardiac mortality. The risk of SCD is heritable but the underlying genetic variants are largely unknown. We investigated whether common genetic variants predisposing to arrhythmia or related electrocardiographic phenotypes, including QT-interval prolongation, are associated with increased risk of SCD. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We studied the association between 28 candidate SNPs and SCD in a meta-analysis of four population cohorts (FINRISK 1992, 1997, 2002 and Health 2000, n = 27,629) and two forensic autopsy series (The Helsinki Sudden Death Study and The Tampere Autopsy Study, n = 694). We also studied the association between established cardiovascular risk factors and SCD. Causes of death were reviewed using registry-based health and autopsy data. Cox regression and logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and geographic region. The total number of SCDs was 716. Two novel SNPs were associated with SCD: SCN5A rs41312391 (relative risk [RR] 1.27 per minor T allele, 95\% CI 1.11-1.45, P = 3.4×10(-4)) and rs2200733 in 4q25 (RR 1.28 per minor T allele, 95\% CI 1.11-1.48, P = 7.9×10(-4)). We also replicated the associations for 9p21 (rs2383207, RR 1.13 per G allele, 95\% CI 1.01-1.26, P = 0.036), as well as for male sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, low physical activity, coronary heart disease, and digoxin use (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Two novel genetic variants, one in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A and another at 4q25 previously associated with atrial fibrillation, are associated with SCD.},

PARTICIPANTS Elderly adults acutely admitted for hip fracture surgery who developed delirium according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, for 2 days or longer (n = 76, aged 86.4 ± 6.1, 68.4\% female). MEASUREMENTS Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS), Delirium Rating Scale R98 (DRS-R98), comorbidity, and function. RESULTS Median delirium duration was 3 days (interquartile range 2.0 days). At first assessment, the hyperactive motor subtype was most common (44.7\%), followed by hypoactive motor subtype (28.9\%), mixed motor subtype (19.7\%), and no motor subtype (6.6\%). Participants with no motor subtype had lower DRS-R98 scores than those with the other subtypes (P {\textless} .001). The DMSS-defined motor subtype of 47 (61.8\%) participants changed over time. Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, Charlson Comorbidity Index, cognitive impairment, age, sex, and delirium duration or severity were not associated with change in motor subtype. CONCLUSION Motor subtype profile was variable in the majority of participants, although changes that occurred were often related to changes from or to no motor subtype, suggesting evolving or resolving delirium. Changes appeared not be associated with demographic or clinical characteristics, suggesting that evidence from cross-sectional studies of motor subtypes could be applied to many individuals with delirium. Further longitudinal studies should be performed to clarify the stability of motor subtypes in different clinical populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Delirium (or acute confusional state) affects 35\% to 65\% of patients after hip-fracture repair, and has been independently associated with poor functional recovery. We performed a randomized trial in an orthopedic surgery service at an academic hospital to determine whether proactive geriatrics consultation can reduce delirium after hip fracture. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, blinded. SETTING Inpatient academic tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS 126 consenting patients 65 and older (mean age 79 +/- 8 years, 79\% women) admitted emergently for surgical repair of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS Detailed assessment through interviews with patients and designated proxies and review of medical records was performed at enrollment to ascertain prefracture status. Subjects were then randomized to proactive geriatrics consultation, which began preoperatively or within 24 hours of surgery, or "usual care." A geriatrician made daily visits for the duration of the hospitalization and made targeted recommendations based on a structured protocol. To ascertain study outcomes, all subjects underwent daily, blinded interviews for the duration of their hospitalization, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI), and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm. RESULTS The 62 patients randomized to geriatrics consultation were not significantly different (P{\textgreater}.1) from the 64 usual-care patients in terms of age, gender, prefracture dementia, comorbidity, type of hip fracture, or type of surgical repair. Sixty-one percent of geriatrics consultation patients were seen preoperatively and all were seen within 24 hours postoperatively. A mean of 10 recommendations were made throughout the duration of the hospitalization, with 77\% adherence by the orthopedics team. Delirium occurred in 20 /62 (32\%) intervention patients, versus 32 / 64 (50\%) usual-care patients (P =.04), representing a relative risk of 0.64 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.37-0.98) for the consultation group. One case of delirium was prevented for every 5.6 patients in the geriatrics consultation group. There was an even greater reduction in cases of severe delirium, occurring in 7/ 60 (12\%) of intervention patients and 18 / 62 (29\%) of usual-care patients, with a relative risk of 0.40 (95\% CI = 0.18-0.89). Despite this reduction in delirium, length of stay did not significantly differ between intervention and usual-care groups (median +/- interquartile range = 5 +/- 2 days in both groups), likely because protocols and pathways predetermined length of stay. In subgroup analyses, geriatrics consultation was most effective in reducing delirium in patients without prefracture dementia or activities of daily living (ADL) functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS Proactive geriatrics consultation was successfully implemented with good adherence after hip-fracture repair. Geriatrics consultation reduced delirium by over one-third, and reduced severe delirium by over one-half. Our trial provides strong preliminary evidence that proactive geriatrics consultation may play an important role in the acute hospital management of hip-fracture patients.},

RESULTS A total of 969 patients in 8 studies met the selection criteria. The results revealed that dexmedetomidine was associated with a lower risk of delirium (risk ratio, 0.40;95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.64; P=.0002), a shorter length of intubation (hours; mean difference, -0.95; 95\% CI, -1.26 to -0.64; P{\textless}.00001), but a higher incidence of bradycardia (risk ratio 3.17; 95\% CI, 1.41-7.10; P=.005) as compared to propofol. There were no statistical differences in the incidence of hypotension or atrial fibrillation, or the length of intensive care unit stay between dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation regimens. CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine sedation could reduce postoperative delirium and was associated with shorter length of intubation, but might increase bradycardia in patients after cardiac surgery compared with propofol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Since in hospitalized older patients delirium is associated with poor outcomes, we evaluated the effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy for the prevention of delirium. METHODS We studied 852 patients 70 years of age or older who had been admitted to the general-medicine service at a teaching hospital. Patients from one intervention unit and two usual-care units were enrolled by means of a prospective matching strategy. The intervention consisted of standardized protocols for the management of six risk factors for delirium: cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and dehydration. Delirium, the primary outcome, was assessed daily until discharge. RESULTS Delirium developed in 9.9 percent of the intervention group as compared with 15.0 percent of the usual-care group, (matched odds ratio, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.92). The total number of days with delirium (105 vs. 161, P=0.02) and the total number of episodes (62 vs. 90, P=0.03) were significantly lower in the intervention group. However, the severity of delirium and recurrence rates were not significantly different. The overall rate of adherence to the intervention was 87 percent, and the total number of targeted risk factors per patient was significantly reduced. Intervention was associated with significant improvement in the degree of cognitive impairment among patients with cognitive impairment at admission and a reduction in the rate of use of sleep medications among all patients. Among the other risk factors per patient there were trends toward improvement in immobility, visual impairment, and hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS The risk-factor intervention strategy that we studied resulted in significant reductions in the number and duration of episodes of delirium in hospitalized older patients. The intervention had no significant effect on the severity of delirium or on recurrence rates; this finding suggests that primary prevention of delirium is probably the most effective treatment strategy.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Major postoperative complications and delirium contribute independently to adverse outcomes and high resource use in patients who undergo major surgery; however, their interrelationship is not well examined. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of major postoperative complications and delirium, alone and combined, with adverse outcomes after surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study in 2 large academic medical centers of 566 patients who were 70 years or older without recognized dementia or a history of delirium and underwent elective major orthopedic, vascular, or abdominal surgical procedures with a minimum 3-day hospitalization between June 18, 2010, and August 8, 2013. Data analysis took place from December 13, 2013, through May 1, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major postoperative complications, defined as life-altering or life-threatening events (Accordion Severity grade 2 or higher), were identified by expert-panel adjudication. Delirium was measured daily with the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated medical record review method. The following 4 subgroups were analyzed: (1) no complications or delirium; (2) complications only; (3) delirium only; and (4) complications and delirium. Adverse outcomes included a length of stay (LOS) of more than 5 days, institutional discharge, and rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS In the 566 participants, the mean (SD) age was 76.7 (5.2) years, 236 (41.7\%) were male, and 523 (92.4\%) were white. Forty-seven patients (8.3\%) developed major complications and 135 (23.9\%) developed delirium. Compared with no complications or delirium as the reference group, major complications only contributed to prolonged LOS only (relative risk [RR], 2.8; 95\% CI, 1.9-4.0); by contrast, delirium only significantly increased all adverse outcomes, including prolonged LOS (RR, 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.4-2.7), institutional discharge (RR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.7), and 30-day readmission (RR, 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.4-3.7). The subgroup with complications and delirium had the highest rates of all adverse outcomes, including prolonged LOS (RR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 2.3-4.8), institutional discharge (RR, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.4-2.5), and 30-day readmission (RR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.3-6.8). Delirium exerted the highest attributable risk at the population level (5.8\%; 95\% CI, 4.7-6.8) compared with all other adverse events (prolonged LOS, institutional discharge, or readmission). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Major postoperative complications and delirium are separately associated with adverse events and demonstrate a combined effect. Delirium occurs more frequently and has a greater effect at the population level than other major complications.},

Studies consistently demonstrate elevated levels of serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and possibly triglycerides in individuals with overt hypothyroidism, all of which are reversible with levothyroxine therapy. Although it is estimated that 1 to 11\% of all patients with dyslipidemia have subclinical hypothyroidism, the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism on serum lipid values are less clear. Apolipoprotein B levels may be increased in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. Although some studies have demonstrated that total cholesterol and LDL-C levels are elevated in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, others have not shown any effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on these lipid measurements. Serum triglycerides, lipid subparticle size, and LDL-C oxidizability may be altered in subclinical hypothyroidism, but these studies have also been inconsistent. The preponderance of evidence suggests that HDL-C and lipoprotein(a) levels are not altered in subclinically hypothyroid patients. Smoking and insulin resistance may modify the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism on serum lipid values.

METHODS Individual data on 52 674 participants were pooled from 10 cohorts. Coronary heart disease events were analyzed in 22 437 participants from 6 cohorts with available data, and incident AF was analyzed in 8711 participants from 5 cohorts. Euthyroidism was defined as thyrotropin level between 0.45 and 4.49 mIU/L and endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism as thyrotropin level lower than 0.45 mIU/L with normal free thyroxine levels, after excluding those receiving thyroid-altering medications. RESULTS Of 52 674 participants, 2188 (4.2\%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. During follow-up, 8527 participants died (including 1896 from CHD), 3653 of 22 437 had CHD events, and 785 of 8711 developed AF. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with increased total mortality (hazard ratio[HR], 1.24, 95\% CI, 1.06-1.46), CHD mortality (HR,1.29; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.62), CHD events (HR, 1.21; 95\%CI, 0.99-1.46), and AF (HR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.43).Risks did not differ significantly by age, sex, or preexisting cardiovascular disease and were similar after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with attributable risk of 14.5\% for total mortality to 41.5\% forAF in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Risks for CHD mortality and AF (but not other outcomes) were higher for thyrotropin level lower than 0.10 mIU/L compared with thyrotropin level between 0.10 and 0.44 mIU/L(for both, P value for trend, .03). CONCLUSION Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risks of total, CHD mortality, and incident AF, with highest risks of CHD mortality and AF when thyrotropin level is lower than 0.10 mIU/L.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Thyroid dysfunction predicts poorer health outcomes, but the relationship between thyroid hormone levels within the reference range and mortality in older adults remains unclear. In this study, we examined the associations between the concentrations of free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH and all-cause mortality in older men without thyroid disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We performed a longitudinal study in community-dwelling men aged 70-89 years. Men with thyroid disease or taking thyroid-related medications were excluded. Baseline FT4 and TSH levels were assayed. Incident deaths were ascertained using data linkage. RESULTS There were 3885 men without thyroid disease followed for (means.d.) 6.41.5 years, during which time 837 had died (21.5\%). men who had died had higher baseline ft4 levels (16.22.3 vs 15.82.1 pmol/l, p0.001), but comparable tsh levels (2.41.5 vs 2.31.5 miu/l, P=0.250). After accounting for age, smoking, physical factors and medical comorbidities, higher circulating ft4 levels predicted all-cause mortality (quartile Q4 vs quartiles Q1Q3: FT4 levels ≥ 17.32 vs {\textless}17.32 pmol/l: adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.19, 95\% CI=1.02-1.39, P=0.025). TSH levels did not predict mortality. After excluding men with subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, there were 3442 men and 737 who had died (21.4\%). In these men, higher FT4 levels remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (quartile Q4 vs quartiles Q1-Q3: adjusted HR=1.19, 95\% CI=1.02-1.41, P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS Higher FT4 levels are associated with all-cause mortality in euthyroid older men, independently of conventional risk factors and medical comorbidities. Additional research is needed to determine whether or not this relationship is causal and to clarify the utility of thyroid function testing to stratify mortality risk in ageing men.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Delirium is a common mental disorder with serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. It is associated with increases in mortality, physical morbidity, length of hospital stay, institutionalisation and costs to healthcare providers. A range of risk factors has been implicated in its aetiology, including aspects of the routine care and environment in hospitals. Prevention of delirium is clearly desirable from patients' and carers' perspectives, and to reduce hospital costs. Yet it is currently unclear whether interventions for prevention of delirium are effective, whether they can be successfully delivered in all environments, and whether different interventions are necessary for different groups of patients. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. We also aimed to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence to prevent delirium in these settings. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 28th September, 2005. As the searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO for the Specialized Register would not necessarily have picked up all delirium prevention trials, these databases were searched again on 28th October, 2005. We also examined reference lists of retrieved articles, reviews and books. Experts in this field were contacted and the Internet searched for further references and to locate unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials evaluating any interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data collection and quality assessment were performed by three reviewers independently and agreement reached by consensus. MAIN RESULTS Six studies with a total of 833 participants were identified for inclusion. All were conducted in surgical settings, five in orthopaedic surgery and one in patients undergoing resection for gastric or colon cancer. Only one study of 126 hip fracture patients comparing proactive geriatric consultation with usual care was sufficiently powered to detect a difference in the primary outcome, incident delirium. Total cumulative delirium incidence during admission was reduced in the intervention group (OR 0.48 [95\% CI 0.23, 0.98]; RR 0.64 [95\% CI 0.37, 0.98]), suggesting a 'number needed to treat' of 5.6 patients to prevent one case. The intervention was particularly effective in preventing severe delirium. In logistic regression analyses adjusting for pre fracture dementia and Activities of Daily Living impairment, there was no reduction in effect size, OR 0.6, but this no longer remained significant [95\% CI 0.3,1.3]. There was no effect on the duration of delirium episodes, length of hospital stay, and cognitive status or institutionalisation at discharge. There was also no significant difference in cumulative delirium incidence between treatment and control groups in a sub-group of 50 patients with dementia (RR 0.9 [95\% CI 0.59, 1.36]). In another trial of low dose haloperidol prophylaxis, there was no difference in delirium incidence but the severity and duration of a delirium episode, and length of hospital stay were all reduced. We identified no completed studies in hospitalised medical, care of the elderly, general surgery, cancer or intensive care patients. In outcomes, no studies examined for death, use of psychotropic medication, activities of daily living, psychological morbidity, quality of life, carers or staff psychological morbidity, cost of intervention and cost to health care services. Outcomes were only reported up to discharge, with no studies reporting medium or longer-term effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Research evidence on effectiveness of interventions to prevent delirium is sparse. Based on a single study, a programme of proactive geriatric consultation may reduce delirium incidence and severity in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Prophylactic low dose haloperidol may reduce severity and duration of delirium episodes and shorten length of hospital admission in hip surgery. Further studies of delirium prevention are needed.},

We undertook the present study to investigate the association between decreased serum TSH levels and mortality in the large population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). DESIGN AND METHODS Data from 3651 individuals from SHIP without known thyroid disorders or thyroid treatment were analyzed. Serum TSH, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine levels were determined by immunochemiluminescent procedures. Decreased TSH was defined as serum TSH levels below 0.25 mIU/l. Cox regression was used to associate decreased TSH levels with mortality. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 8.5 years (30 126 person years). During follow-up, 299 individuals (6.9\%) died corresponding to a death rate of 9.92 deaths per 1000 person years. Survival time was shorter in subjects with decreased serum TSH levels compared to euthyroid individuals. After adjustment for age and sex, however, there was no association between decreased serum TSH levels and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.95; 95\% confidence interval: 0.67; 1.36). Likewise, decreased serum TSH levels were neither associated with cardiovascular nor with cancer mortality.

We compared the effect of melatonin and placebo on the incidence and duration of delirium. METHODS We performed this multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial between November 2008 and May 2012 in 1 academic and 2 nonacademic hospitals. Patients aged 65 years or older who were scheduled for acute hip surgery were eligible for inclusion. Patients received melatonin 3 mg or placebo in the evening for 5 consecutive days, starting within 24 hours after admission. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium within 8 days of admission. We also monitored the duration of delirium. RESULTS A total of 452 patients were randomly assigned to the 2 study groups. We subsequently excluded 74 patients for whom the primary end point could not be measured or who had delirium before the second day of the study. After these postrandomization exclusions, data for 378 patients were included in the main analysis. The overall mean age was 84 years, 238 (63.0\%) of the patients lived at home before admission, and 210 (55.6\%) had cognitive impairment. We observed no effect of melatonin on the incidence of delirium: 55/186 (29.6\%) in the melatonin group v. 49/192 (25.5\%) in the placebo group; difference 4.1 (95\% confidence interval -0.05 to 13.1) percentage points.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The association between thyroid function and cardiovascular disease is well established, but no study to date has assessed whether it is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Therefore, we studied the association of thyroid function with SCD in a prospective population-based cohort. METHODS Participants from the Rotterdam Study ≥45 years with thyroid-stimulating hormone or free thyroxine (FT4) measurements and clinical follow-up were eligible. We assessed the association of thyroid-stimulating hormone and FT4 with the risk of SCD by using an age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards model, in all participants and also after restricting the analysis to euthyroid participants (defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.4-4.0 mIU/L). Additional adjustment included cardiovascular risk factors, notably hypertension, serum cholesterol, and smoking. We stratified by age and sex and performed sensitivity analyses by excluding participants with abnormal FT4 values (reference range of 0.85-1.95 ng/dL) and including only witnessed SCDs as outcome. Absolute risks were calculated in a competing risk model by taking death by other causes into account. RESULTS We included 10 318 participants with 261 incident SCDs (median follow-up, 9.1 years). Higher levels of FT4 were associated with an increased SCD risk, even in the normal range of thyroid function (hazard ratio, 2.28 per 1 ng/dL FT4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.31-3.97). Stratification by age or sex and sensitivity analyses did not change the risk estimates substantially. The absolute 10-year risk of SCD increased in euthyroid participants from 1\% to 4\% with increasing FT4 levels. CONCLUSIONS Higher FT4 levels are associated with an increased risk of SCD, even in euthyroid participants.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Delirium is characterized by disturbances in circadian rhythm. Melatonin regulates our circadian rhythm. Our aim was to compare preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin levels in patients with and without postoperative delirium. METHODS Prospective cohort study with hip fracture patients ≥ 65 years who were acutely admitted to the hospital for surgical treatment and received spinal anaesthesia. CSF was collected after cannulation, before administering anaesthetics. Melatonin was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Data on delirium was obtained from medical and nursing records. Nurses screened every shift for delirium using the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS). If the DOSS was ≥3, a psychiatrist was consulted to diagnose possible delirium using the DSM-IV criteria. At admission, demographic data, medical history, and information on functional and cognitive status was obtained. RESULTS Seventy-six patients met the inclusion criteria. Sixty patients were included in the analysis. Main reasons for exclusion were technical difficulties, insufficient CSF or exogenous melatonin use. Thirteen patients (21.7\%) experienced delirium during hospitalisation. Baseline characteristics did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium. In patients with and without postoperative delirium melatonin levels were 12.88 pg/ml (SD 6.3) and 11.72 pg/ml (SD 4.5) respectively, p-value 0.47. No differences between patients with and without delirium were found in mean melatonin levels in analyses stratified for cognitive impairment or age. CONCLUSION Preoperative CSF melatonin levels did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium. This suggests that, if disturbances in melatonin secretion occur, these might occur after surgery due to postoperative inflammation.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist medications are the most commonly used sedatives for intensive care unit (ICU) patients, yet preliminary evidence indicates that the alpha(2) agonist dexmedetomidine may have distinct advantages. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of prolonged sedation with dexmedetomidine vs midazolam for mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Prospective, double-blind, randomized trial conducted in 68 centers in 5 countries between March 2005 and August 2007 among 375 medical/surgical ICU patients with expected mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Sedation level and delirium were assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. INTERVENTIONS Dexmedetomidine (0.2-1.4 microg/kg per hour [n = 244]) or midazolam (0.02-0.1 mg/kg per hour [n = 122]) titrated to achieve light sedation (RASS scores between -2 and +1) from enrollment until extubation or 30 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of time within target RASS range. Secondary end points included prevalence and duration of delirium, use of fentanyl and open-label midazolam, and nursing assessments. Additional outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and adverse events. RESULTS There was no difference in percentage of time within the target RASS range (77.3\% for dexmedetomidine group vs 75.1\% for midazolam group; difference, 2.2\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, -3.2\% to 7.5\%]; P = .18). The prevalence of delirium during treatment was 54\% (n = 132/244) in dexmedetomidine-treated patients vs 76.6\% (n = 93/122) in midazolam-treated patients (difference, 22.6\% [95\% CI, 14\% to 33\%]; P {\textless} .001). Median time to extubation was 1.9 days shorter in dexmedetomidine-treated patients (3.7 days [95\% CI, 3.1 to 4.0] vs 5.6 days [95\% CI, 4.6 to 5.9]; P = .01), and ICU length of stay was similar (5.9 days [95\% CI, 5.7 to 7.0] vs 7.6 days [95\% CI, 6.7 to 8.6]; P = .24). Dexmedetomidine-treated patients were more likely to develop bradycardia (42.2\% [103/244] vs 18.9\% [23/122]; P {\textless} .001), with a nonsignificant increase in the proportion requiring treatment (4.9\% [12/244] vs 0.8\% [1/122]; P = .07), but had a lower likelihood of tachycardia (25.4\% [62/244] vs 44.3\% [54/122]; P {\textless} .001) or hypertension requiring treatment (18.9\% [46/244] vs 29.5\% [36/122]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS There was no difference between dexmedetomidine and midazolam in time at targeted sedation level in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. At comparable sedation levels, dexmedetomidine-treated patients spent less time on the ventilator, experienced less delirium, and developed less tachycardia and hypertension. The most notable adverse effect of dexmedetomidine was bradycardia. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00216190 Published online February 2, 2009 (doi:10.1001/jama.2009.56).},

	abstract = {Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α 2 agonist used as a sedative agent. It also provides anxiolysis and sympatholysis without significant respiratory compromise or delirium. We conducted a systematic review to examine whether sedation of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with dexmedetomidine was associated with a lower incidence of delirium as compared to other nondexmedetomidine sedation strategies. A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews yielded only three trials from 1966 through April 2015 that met our predefined inclusion criteria and assessed dexmedetomidine and outcomes of delirium as their primary endpoint. The studies varied in regard to population, comparator sedation regimen, delirium outcome measure, and dexmedetomidine dosing. All trials are limited by design issues that limit our ability definitively to conclude that dexmedetomidine prevents delirium. Evidence does suggest that dexmedetomidine may allow for avoidance of deep sedation and use of benzodiazepines, factors both observed to increase the risk for developing delirium. Our assessment of currently published literature highlights the need for ongoing research to better delineate the role of dexmedetomidine for delirium prevention.},

	abstract = {Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent syndrome affecting about 10 million people in the United States. The management of such patients is open to debate. In a long-term prospective study we analyzed the spontaneous course and the value of predictive factors in the development of overt thyroid failure. We studied 82 female patients with subclinical hypothyroidism prospectively over a mean observation period of 9.2 yr. TSH, thyroid hormones, thyroid reserve after TRH administration, thyroid antibodies, and clinical parameters were assessed at yearly intervals. The cumulative incidence of overt hypothyroidism was calculated using life-table analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. According to the initial serum TSH concentrations (TSH, 4-6/{\textgreater}6-12/{\textgreater}12 mU/liter), Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of overt hypothyroidism were 0\%, 42.8\%, and 76.9\%, respectively, after 10 yr (P {\textless} 0.0001). When only patients with TSH levels greater than 6 mU/liter were analyzed, the cumulative incidence was 55.3\%. The incidence of overt hypothyroidism increased in patients with impaired thyroid reserve (52.6\% vs. 38.1\%; P = 0.05) and positive microsomal antibodies (58.5\% vs. 23.2\%; P = 0.03). This prospective long-term study demonstrates that only a part of the cohort of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism develops overt hypothyroidism over time and that a major group remains in the subclinical state after 10 yr. The measurement of TSH, microsomal (thyroperoxidase) antibodies, and thyroid reserve allows initial risk stratification for the development of overt thyroid failure (risk ratio ranging from 1.0-15.6). Our study helps to recognize the spontaneous course of subclinical hypothyroidism and in the identification of patients most likely to progress to overt hypothyroidism.},

	abstract = {We aimed to analyze the natural course of subclinical hypothyroidism, quantify the incidence rate of overt hypothyroidism, and evaluate the risk factors for the development of definitive thyroid failure in elderly patients. One hundred seven patients (93 women and 14 men) over age 55 yr with subclinical hypothyroidism and no previous history of thyroid disease were prospectively studied. Subjects were followed up for 6-72 months (mean, 31.7 months) with repeated determinations of TSH and free T(4). Twenty-eight patients (26.8\%) developed overt hypothyroidism, and 40 (37.4\%) showed normalization of their TSH values. The incidence rate of overt hypothyroidism was 9.91 cases per 100 patient-years in the whole population, and 1.76, 19.67, and 73.47 cases per 100 patient-years in subjects with initial TSH values between 5.0-9.9, 10.0-14.9, and 15.0-19.9 mU/liter, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the development of definitive thyroid hypofunction was significantly related to the presence of symptoms of hypothyroidism, goiter, positive thyroid antibodies (P {\textless} 0.05), and mainly low normal free T(4) (P {\textless} 0.01) and high TSH (P {\textless} 0.0001) concentrations at baseline. A stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the only significant factor for progression to overt hypothyroidism was serum TSH concentration (P {\textless} 0.0001). In conclusion, TSH concentration is the most powerful predictor for the outcome of spontaneous subclinical hypothyroidism in patients over age 55 yr. Subjects with mildly elevated TSH have a low incidence rate of overt hypothyroidism. We recommend follow-up with clinical and biochemical monitoring in these patients.},

	abstract = {Aldosterone-receptor antagonists dose-dependently reduce both the epithelial and nonepithelial actions of aldosterone. These compounds are used commonly in the treatment of hypertension, with or without aldosteronism, and in the volume-overload periods of various forms of heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure. In this regard, the relevant site of action for these compounds is compartmentalized to the distal nephron. The cardiac benefits of aldosterone-receptor blockade now are sufficiently well established to warrant routine use of these compounds for their survival benefits in moderate to advanced stages of heart failure. Aldosterone-receptor antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone commonly are used in the treatment of resistant forms of hypertension. Spironolactone, but not eplerenone, is a commonly used add-on diuretic that provides incremental benefit for salt-and-water excretion in excess of what may be seen with a loop diuretic given together with a thiazide-type diuretic. The dose-response relationship for natriuresis with spironolactone has not been explored completely as to its combination therapy responses. The quite high doses of spironolactone used in patients with cirrhosis and ascites would infer that the overall treatment effect with this compound exceeds simple receptor blockade and may include a nervous system effect that operationally reduces renal sympathetic nerve traffic. The adverse electrolyte and renal function side effects with aldosterone-receptor antagonists are not uncommon in at-risk patients, such as those with chronic kidney disease, and require that dosing be mindful of the tendency of these drugs to importantly increase serum potassium levels. ?? 2014.},

Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than warfarin. METHODS In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 14,264 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke to receive either rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of 20 mg) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The per-protocol, as-treated primary analysis was designed to determine whether rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism. RESULTS In the primary analysis, the primary end point occurred in 188 patients in the rivaroxaban group (1.7\% per year) and in 241 in the warfarin group (2.2\% per year) (hazard ratio in the rivaroxaban group, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.96; P{\textless}0.001 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 269 patients in the rivaroxaban group (2.1\% per year) and in 306 patients in the warfarin group (2.4\% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.03; P{\textless}0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.12 for superiority). Major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 1475 patients in the rivaroxaban group (14.9\% per year) and in 1449 in the warfarin group (14.5\% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.11; P=0.44), with significant reductions in intracranial hemorrhage (0.5\% vs. 0.7\%, P=0.02) and fatal bleeding (0.2\% vs. 0.5\%, P=0.003) in the rivaroxaban group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of major bleeding, although intracranial and fatal bleeding occurred less frequently in the rivaroxaban group.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Nivolumab (a programmed death 1 [PD-1] checkpoint inhibitor) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] checkpoint inhibitor) have been shown to have complementary activity in metastatic melanoma. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab was compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS We assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 945 previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma to nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone. Progression-free survival and overall survival were coprimary end points. Results regarding progression-free survival are presented here. RESULTS The median progression-free survival was 11.5 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.9 to 16.7) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with 2.9 months (95\% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) with ipilimumab (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.42; 99.5\% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001), and 6.9 months (95\% CI, 4.3 to 9.5) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for the comparison with ipilimumab, 0.57; 99.5\% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P{\textless}0.001). In patients with tumors positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), the median progression-free survival was 14.0 months in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, but in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, progression-free survival was longer with the combination therapy than with nivolumab alone (11.2 months [95\% CI, 8.0 to not reached] vs. 5.3 months [95\% CI, 2.8 to 7.1]). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 16.3\% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 55.0\% of those in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 27.3\% of those in the ipilimumab group. CONCLUSIONS Among previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma, nivolumab alone or combined with ipilimumab resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than ipilimumab alone. In patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade was more effective than either agent alone.

	abstract = {Our aim was to identify and quantify the major in vivo pathways of lipoprotein cholesteryl ester transport in humans. Normal (n = 7), bile fistula (n = 5), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; n = 1) subjects were studied. Each received isotopic free cholesterol in HDL, LDL, or particulate form, along with another isotope of free or esterified cholesterol or mevalonic acid. VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL, HDL, blood cells, and bile were collected for up to 6 days for analysis of radioactivity and mass of free and esterified cholesterol. These raw data were subjected to compartmental analysis using the SAAM program. Results in all groups corroborated net transport of free cholesterol to the liver from HDL, shown previously in fistula subjects. New findings revealed that 70\% of ester was produced from free cholesterol in HDL and 30\% from free cholesterol in LDL, IDL, and VLDL. No evidence was found for tissue-produced ester in plasma. There was net transfer of cholesteryl ester to VLDL and IDL from HDL and considerable exchange between LDL and HDL. Irreversible ester output was from VLDL, IDL, and LDL, but very little was from HDL, suggesting that selective and holoparticle uptakes of HDL ester are minor pathways in humans. It follows that 1) they contribute little to reverse transport, 2) very high HDL would not result from defects thereof, and 3) the clinical benefit of high HDL is likely explained by other mechanisms. Reverse transport in the subjects with bile fistula and FH was facilitated by ester output to the liver from VLDL plus IDL.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which are inversely related to risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, involves a complex interplay of factors regulating HDL synthesis, intravascular remodeling, and catabolism. The individual lipid and apolipoprotein components of HDL are mostly assembled after secretion, are frequently exchanged with or transferred to other lipoproteins, are actively remodeled within the plasma compartment, and are often cleared separately from one another. HDL is believed to play a key role in the process of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), in which it promotes the efflux of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and returns it to the liver for biliary excretion. This review will emphasize 3 major evolving themes regarding HDL metabolism and RCT. The first theme is that HDL is a universal plasma acceptor lipoprotein for cholesterol efflux from not only peripheral tissues but also hepatocytes, which are a major source of cholesterol efflux to HDL. Furthermore, although efflux of cholesterol from macrophages represents only a tiny fraction of overall cellular cholesterol efflux, it is the most important with regard to atherosclerosis, suggesting that it be specifically termed macrophage RCT. The second theme is the critical role that intravascular remodeling of HDL by lipid transfer factors, lipases, cell surface receptors, and non-HDL lipoproteins play in determining the ultimate metabolic fate of HDL and plasma HDL-c concentrations. The third theme is the growing appreciation that insulin resistance underlies the majority of cases of low HDL-c in humans and the mechanisms by which insulin resistance influences HDL metabolism. Progress in our understanding of HDL metabolism and macrophage reverse cholesterol transport will increase the likelihood of developing novel therapies to raise plasma HDL concentrations and promote macrophage RCT and in proving that these new therapeutic interventions prevent or cause regression of atherosclerosis in humans.},

However, the mechanisms by which LDL cholesterol reaches the plasma membrane (PM) have remained obscure. Here, we applied LDL labeled with BODIPY cholesteryl linoleate to identify this pathway in living cells. The egress of BODIPY cholesterol (BC) from late endosomal (LE) organelles was dependent on acid lipase and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, as for natural cholesterol. We show that NPC1 was needed to recruit Rab8a to BC-containing LEs, and Rab8a enhanced the motility and segregation of BC- and CD63-positive organelles from lysosomes. The BC carriers docked to the cortical actin by a Rab8a- and Myosin5b (Myo5b)-dependent mechanism, typically in the proximity of focal adhesions (FAs). LDL increased the number and dynamics of FAs and stimulated cell migration in an acid lipase, NPC1, and Rab8a-dependent fashion, providing evidence that this cholesterol delivery route to the PM is important for cell movement.},

	abstract = {Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction, which has triggered the hypothesis that HDL, in contrast to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), acts as an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein. Moreover, experimental studies have identified potential anti-atherogenic properties of HDL, including promotion of macrophage cholesterol efflux and direct endothelial-protective effects of HDL, such as stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide production and repair, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Studies in gene-targeted mice, however, have also indicated that increasing HDL-cholesterol plasma levels can either limit (e.g. apolipoprotein A-I) or accelerate (e.g. Scavenger receptor class B type I) atherosclerosis. Moreover, vascular effects of HDL have been observed to be heterogenous and are altered in patients with CAD or diabetes, a condition that has been termed 'HDL dysfunction'. These alterations in biological functions of HDL may need to be taken into account for HDL-targeted therapies and considering raising of HDL-cholesterol levels alone is likely not sufficient in this respect. It will therefore be important to further determine, which biological functions of HDL are critical for its anti-atherosclerotic properties, as well as how these can be measured and targeted.},

There is, therefore, a need to develop suitable therapies to reduce this residual risk. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are an important independent risk factor for CVD. Though fibrates, niacin, and statins have been shown to modestly raise HDL-C, there is increasing recognition of the need to develop therapies that can increase HDL-C more robustly. Such therapies may help supplement the LDL-C-lowering benefits of statins. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been identified as a possible strategy for substantially increasing HDL-C levels and CETP inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy, in terms of increasing HDL-C, in preliminary clinical trials, and clinical trials based on outcomes are ongoing.

These novel apoA-I mimetics, with long hydrocarbon chain (C(5-8)) amino acids incorporated in the amphipathic α helix of the apoA-I(cons), have the following properties: (i) they stimulate in vitro cholesterol efflux from macrophages via ABCA1; (ii) they associate with HDL and cause formation of pre-β HDL particles when incubated with human and mouse plasma; (iii) they associate with HDL and induce pre-β HDL formation in vivo, with a corresponding increase in ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux capacity ex vivo; (iv) at high dose they associate with VLDL and induce hypertriglyceridemia in mice. These results suggest our peptide design confers activities that are potentially anti-atherogenic. However a dosing regimen which maximizes their therapeutic properties while minimizing adverse effects needs to be established.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery in the 1970s that plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are inversely associated with cardiovascular outcome, it has been postulated that HDL is anti-atherogenic and that increasing HDL-C levels is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the recent failure of three orally active, HDL-C-raising agents has introduced considerable controversy, prompting the question of whether increasing the cholesterol cargo of HDL in a non-selective manner is an effective pharmacological approach for the translation of its atheroprotective and vasculoprotective activities. The interrelationships between HDL-C concentration, HDL particle number and levels of diverse HDL particle subpopulations of defined composition are complex, as are their relationships with reverse cholesterol transport and other anti-atherogenic functions. Such complexity highlights the incompleteness of our understanding of the biology of HDL particles. This article examines the HDL hypothesis in molecular and mechanistic terms, focusing on features that have been addressed, those that remain to be tested, and potential new targets for future pharmacological interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been shown to have a substantial effect on plasma lipoprotein levels. We investigated whether torcetrapib, a potent CETP inhibitor, might reduce major cardiovascular events. The trial was terminated prematurely because of an increased risk of death and cardiac events in patients receiving torcetrapib. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind study involving 15,067 patients at high cardiovascular risk. The patients received either torcetrapib plus atorvastatin or atorvastatin alone. The primary outcome was the time to the first major cardiovascular event, which was defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS At 12 months in patients who received torcetrapib, there was an increase of 72.1\% in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease of 24.9\% in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as compared with baseline (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons), in addition to an increase of 5.4 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, a decrease in serum potassium, and increases in serum sodium, bicarbonate, and aldosterone (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons). There was also an increased risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.44; P=0.001) and death from any cause (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 2.19; P=0.006). Post hoc analyses showed an increased risk of death in patients treated with torcetrapib whose reduction in potassium or increase in bicarbonate was greater than the median change. CONCLUSIONS Torcetrapib therapy resulted in an increased risk of mortality and morbidity of unknown mechanism. Although there was evidence of an off-target effect of torcetrapib, we cannot rule out adverse effects related to CETP inhibition. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00134264 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).},

	abstract = {Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is an important member of the scavenger receptor family of integral membrane glycoproteins. This review highlights studies in SR-BI knockout mice, which concern the role of SR-BI in cholesterol and steroid metabolism. SR-BI in hepatocytes is the sole molecule involved in selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL). SR-BI plays a physiological role in binding and uptake of native apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins by hepatocytes, which identifies SR-BI as a multi-purpose player in lipid uptake from the blood circulation into hepatocytes in mice. In adrenocortical cells, SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl esters, which is efficiently coupled to the synthesis of glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone). SR-BI knockout mice suffer from adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency, which suggests that functional SR-BI protein is necessary for optimal adrenal steroidogenesis in mice. SR-BI in macrophages plays a dual role in cholesterol metabolism as it is able to take up cholesterol associated with HDL and apoB-containing lipoproteins and can possibly facilitate cholesterol efflux to HDL. Absence of SR-BI is associated with thrombocytopenia and altered thrombosis susceptibility, which suggests a novel role for SR-BI in regulating platelet number and function in mice. Transgenic expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in humanized SR-BI knockout mice normalizes hepatic delivery of HDL-cholesteryl esters. However, other pathologies associated with SR-BI deficiency, i.e. increased atherosclerosis susceptibility, adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency, and impaired platelet function are not normalized, which suggests an important role for SR-BI in cholesterol and steroid metabolism in man. In conclusion, generation of SR-BI knockout mice has significantly contributed to our knowledge of the physiological role of SR-BI. Studies using these mice have identified SR-BI as a multi-purpose player in cholesterol and steroid metabolism because it has distinct roles in reverse cholesterol transport, adrenal steroidogenesis, and platelet function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Adoption of automated homogeneous assays for HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is increasing, driven by the need of clinical laboratories to cope with increasing workloads while containing costs. However, performance characteristics of homogeneous assays often differ in important aspects from those of the earlier precipitation methods. This review provides an overview of the new generation of homogeneous assays for HDL-C within the historical context of the evolution of methods and the efforts to standardize measurements of the lipoproteins. APPROACH This is a narrative review based on method evaluations conducted in the laboratories of the authors as well as on relevant publications, especially comparative evaluation studies, from the literature. Publications considered here have been collected by the authors over the past 30 years of involvement as methods for HDL-C made the transition from their early use in lipid research laboratories to clinical laboratories and the recent emergence of homogeneous assays. CONTENT The presentation includes descriptions of methodologies, including homogeneous, precipitation, electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation assays. Reference methods and recommended approaches for assessing accuracy are described. Accuracy and imprecision are summarized in the context of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) standards for analytical performance. The effects of interfering substances and preanalytical sources of variation are presented. SUMMARY Homogeneous assays have been shown to be reasonably well suited for use in routine clinical laboratories, generally meeting the NCEP criteria for precision, accuracy, and total error. However, discrepant results compared with the reference methods have been observed with some of the assays, and the sources of discrepancies are not well characterized. Some homogeneous reagents have not been thoroughly evaluated. At least three of the reagents have experienced successive adjustments in formulation; hence, the reagents may not yet be fully optimized. For these reasons, the homogeneous assays cannot be confidently recommended for use in long-term clinical trials and other research applications without thorough validation.},

	abstract = {Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is the major receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C). In humans, high amounts of HDL-C in plasma are associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mice that have depleted Scarb1 (SR-BI knockout mice) have markedly elevated HDL-C levels but, paradoxically, increased atherosclerosis. The impact of SR-BI on HDL metabolism and CHD risk in humans remains unclear. Through targeted sequencing of coding regions of lipid-modifying genes in 328 individuals with extremely high plasma HDL-C levels, we identified a homozygote for a loss-of-function variant, in which leucine replaces proline 376 (P376L), in SCARB1, the gene encoding SR-BI. The P376L variant impairs posttranslational processing of SR-BI and abrogates selective HDL cholesterol uptake in transfected cells, in hepatocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from the homozygous subject, and in mice. Large population-based studies revealed that subjects who are heterozygous carriers of the P376L variant have significantly increased levels of plasma HDL-C. P376L carriers have a profound HDL-related phenotype and an increased risk of CHD (odds ratio = 1.79, which is statistically significant).},

	abstract = {Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I is the principal protein component of HDL, and because of its conformational adaptability, it can stabilize all HDL subclasses. The amphipathic α-helix is the structural motif that enables apoA-I to achieve this functionality. In the lipid-free state, the helical segments unfold and refold in seconds and are located in the N-terminal two thirds of the molecule where they are loosely packed as a dynamic, four-helix bundle. The C-terminal third of the protein forms an intrinsically disordered domain that mediates initial binding to phospholipid surfaces, which occurs with coupled α-helix formation. The lipid affinity of apoA-I confers detergent-like properties; it can solubilize vesicular phospholipids to create discoidal HDL particles with diameters of approximately 10 nm. Such particles contain a segment of phospholipid bilayer and are stabilized by two apoA-I molecules that are arranged in an anti-parallel, double-belt conformation around the edge of the disc, shielding the hydrophobic phospholipid acyl chains from exposure to water. The apoA-I molecules are in a highly dynamic state, and they stabilize discoidal particles of different sizes by certain segments forming loops that detach reversibly from the particle surface. The flexible apoA-I molecule adapts to the surface of spherical HDL particles by bending and forming a stabilizing trefoil scaffold structure. The above characteristics of apoA-I enable it to partner with ABCA1 in mediating efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol and formation of a heterogeneous population of nascent HDL particles. Novel insights into the structure-function relationships of apoA-I should help reveal mechanisms by which HDL subclass distribution can be manipulated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND It is unclear whether high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration plays a causal role in atherosclerosis. A more important factor may be HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, the ability of HDL to accept cholesterol from macrophages, which is a key step in reverse cholesterol transport. We investigated the epidemiology of cholesterol efflux capacity and its association with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes in a large, multiethnic population cohort. METHODS We measured HDL cholesterol level, HDL particle concentration, and cholesterol efflux capacity at baseline in 2924 adults free from cardiovascular disease who were participants in the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample. The primary end point was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as a first nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization or death from cardiovascular causes. The median follow-up period was 9.4 years. RESULTS In contrast to HDL cholesterol level, which was associated with multiple traditional risk factors and metabolic variables, cholesterol efflux capacity had minimal association with these factors. Baseline HDL cholesterol level was not associated with cardiovascular events in an adjusted analysis (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 1.99). In a fully adjusted model that included traditional risk factors, HDL cholesterol level, and HDL particle concentration, there was a 67\% reduction in cardiovascular risk in the highest quartile of cholesterol efflux capacity versus the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.55). Adding cholesterol efflux capacity to traditional risk factors was associated with improvement in discrimination and reclassification indexes. CONCLUSIONS Cholesterol efflux capacity, a new biomarker that characterizes a key step in reverse cholesterol transport, was inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events in a population-based cohort.

Conventional CAD risk factors do not explain the excess CAD risk; therefore there is a need to identify other markers that can predict future risk of CAD in high-risk SAIs. The objective of the current study is to assess the presence of sub-clinical CAD using common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), and its association with metabolic syndrome (MS) and pro-inflammatory/dysfunctional HDL (Dys-HDL).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A community-based study was conducted on 130 first generation SAIs aged 35-65 years. Dys-HDL was determined using the HDL inflammatory index. Analysis was completed using logistic regression and Fisher's exact test.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Sub-clinical CAD using CCA-IMT ≥ 0.8 mm (as a surrogate marker) was seen in 31.46\%. Age and gender adjusted CCA-IMT was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.008), hypertension (p = 0.012), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p {\textless} 0.001) and homocysteine (p = 0.051). Both the presence of MS and Dys-HDL was significantly correlated with CCA-IMT, even after age and gender adjustment. The odds of having Dys-HDL with CCA-IMT were 5 times (95\% CI: 1.68, 10.78).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: There is a need to explore and understand non-traditional CAD risk factors with a special focus on Dys-HDL, knowing that SAIs have low HDL levels.

	abstract = {Objective: The functionality of HDL has been suggested as an important factor in the prevention of cardiovascular and coronary artery diseases. The objective of the present study was to investigate the functionality of HDL and the factors that may affect the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL in ACS patients. Methods and results: One hundred healthy subjects and 205 ACS patients were recruited. HDL functionality was evaluated by measuring their capacity to mediate cholesterol efflux from J774 macrophages. Oxidative stress status was determined by measuring plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, and vitamin E levels by HPLC. The PON1 Q192R polymorphism status and PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities of the healthy subjects and ACS patients were also determined. The HDL of ACS patients displayed a limited capacity to mediate cholesterol efflux, especially via the ABCA1-pathway. MDA (7.06 ?? 0.29. ??M) and protein carbonyl (9.29 ?? 0.26. ??M) levels were significantly higher in ACS patients than in healthy subjects (2.29 ?? 0.21. ??M and 3.07 ?? 0.17. ??M, respectively, p. {\textless}. 0.0001), while ??- and ??-tocopherol (vitamin E) levels in ACS patients were 8-fold (p. {\textless}. 0.001) and 2-fold (p. {\textless}. 0.05) lower than in healthy subjects. Paraoxonase, arylesterase and HDL-corrected PON1 activities (PON1 activity/HDL ratio) were significantly lower in ACS patients. Logistic regression analyses showed that high PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities had a significant protective effect (OR = 0.413, CI 0.289-0.590, p. {\textless}. 0.001; OR = 0.232 CI 0.107-0.499, p. {\textless}. 0.001, respectively) even when adjusted for HDL level, age, BMI, and PON1 polymorphism. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the functionality of HDL is impaired in ACS patients and that the impairment may be due to oxidative stress and an alteration of PON1 activities.},

	abstract = {High density lipoprotein (HDL) possesses important anti-atherogenic properties and this review addresses the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions. The structures and cholesterol transport abilities of HDL particles are determined by the properties of their exchangeable apolipoprotein (apo) components. ApoA-I and apoE, which are the best characterized in structural terms, contain a series of amphipathic alpha-helical repeats. The helices located in the amino-terminal two-thirds of the molecule adopt a helix bundle structure while the carboxy-terminal segment forms a separately folded, relatively disorganized, domain. The latter domain initiates lipid binding and this interaction induces changes in conformation; the alpha-helix content increases and the amino-terminal helix bundle can open subsequently. These conformational changes alter the abilities of apoA-I and apoE to function as ligands for their receptors. The apoA-I and apoE molecules possess detergent-like properties and they can solubilize vesicular phospholipid to create discoidal HDL particles with hydrodynamic diameters of {\textasciitilde}10 nm. In the case of apoA-I, such a particle is stabilized by two protein molecules arranged in an anti-parallel, double-belt, conformation around the edge of the disc. The abilities of apoA-I and apoE to solubilize phospholipid and stabilize HDL particles enable these proteins to be partners with ABCA1 in mediating efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol, and the biogenesis of HDL particles. ApoA-I-containing nascent HDL particles play a critical role in cholesterol transport in the circulation whereas apoE-containing HDL particles mediate cholesterol transport in the brain. The mechanisms by which HDL particles are remodeled by lipases and lipid transfer proteins, and interact with SR-BI to deliver cholesterol to cells, are reviewed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate independent associations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and particle (HDL-P) concentrations with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and incident coronary heart disease (CHD). BACKGROUND HDL-C is inversely related to CHD, and also to triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P), and related metabolic risk. HDL-P associations with CHD may be partially independent of these factors. METHODS In a multiethnic study of 5,598 men and women ages 45 to 84 years old, without baseline CHD, excluding subjects on lipid-lowering medications, triglycerides {\textgreater}400 mg/dl, or missing values, we evaluated associations of HDL-C and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-measured HDL-P with cIMT and incident CHD (myocardial infarction, CHD death, and angina, n = 227 events; mean 6.0 years follow-up). All models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension, and smoking. RESULTS HDL-C and HDL-P correlated with each other (ρ = 0.69) and LDL-P (ρ = -0.38, -0.25, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05 for all). For (1 SD) higher HDL-C (15 mg/dl) or HDL-P (6.64 μmol/l), cIMT differences were - 26.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -34.7 to -17.4) μm and -30.1 (95\% CI: -38.8 to - 21.4) μm, and CHD hazard ratios were 0.74 (95\% CI: 0.63 to 0.88) and 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.59 to 0.82), respectively. Adjusted for each other and LDL-P, HDL-C was no longer associated with cIMT (2.3; 95\% CI: - 9.5 to 14.2 μm) or CHD (0.97; 95\% CI: 0.77 to 1.22), but HDL-P remained independently associated with cIMT (-22.2; 95\% CI: - 33.8 to -10.6 μm) and CHD (0.75; 95\% CI: 0.61 to 0.93). Interactions by sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Adjusting for each other and LDL-P substantially attenuated associations of HDL-C, but not HDL-P, with cIMT and CHD. Potential confounding by related lipids or lipoproteins should be carefully considered when evaluating HDL-related risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Diminished cholesterol efflux activity of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-depleted serum is associated with prevalent coronary artery disease, but its prognostic value for incident cardiovascular events is unclear. We investigated the relationship of cholesterol efflux activity with both prevalent coronary artery disease and incident development of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). APPROACH AND RESULTS Cholesterol efflux activity from free cholesterol-enriched macrophages was measured in 2 case-control cohorts: (1) an angiographic cohort (n=1150) comprising stable subjects undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography and (2) an outpatient cohort (n=577). Analysis of media from cholesterol efflux assays revealed that the high-density lipoprotein fraction (1.063{\textless}d{\textless}1.21) contained only a minority (≈ 40\%) of [(14)C]cholesterol released, with the majority found within the lipoprotein particle-depleted fraction, where ≈ 60\% was recovered after apolipoprotein A1 immunoprecipitation. Albumin immunoprecipitation recovered another ≈ 30\% of radiolabeled cholesterol within this fraction. Enhanced cholesterol efflux activity from ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-stimulated macrophages was associated with reduced risk of prevalent coronary artery disease in unadjusted models within both cohorts; however, the inverse risk relationship remained significant after adjustment for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors only within the outpatient cohort. Surprisingly, higher cholesterol efflux activity was associated with increase in prospective (3 years) risk of myocardial infarction/stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-4.74) and major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.85; 95\% confidence interval, 1.11-3.06). CONCLUSIONS Heightened cholesterol efflux to apoB-depleted serum was paradoxically associated with increased prospective risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. The majority of released radiolabeled cholesterol from macrophages in cholesterol efflux activity assays does not reside within a high-density lipoprotein particle.},

Major occlusive coronary events were equally strongly associated with the cholesterol- and particle-based total LDL measures; adjusted hazard ratios per 1-SD-higher level were 1.25 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.34) for LDL cholesterol, 1.22 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.32) for non-HDL cholesterol, 1.23 (95\% CI, 1.15-1.33) for apolipoprotein B, and 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.16-1.35) for LDL particle number. Given the total LDL particle number, the distribution between small and large particles did not add predictive value. Associations of these different LDL-related measures were similar with arterial revascularization procedures but much weaker or nonexistent with ischemic stroke and other cardiac events (mainly heart failure). After adjustment for LDL particle number, the hazard ratios for major occlusive coronary event per 1-SD-higher level were 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.86-0.96) for HDL cholesterol and 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.85-0.93) for HDL particle number.

	abstract = {Background High plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, but whether this association is causal is unclear. Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian random isation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal. Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12 482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol. Findings Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2·6\% frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0·14 mmol/L higher p=8×10-13) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with noncarriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13\% (odds ratio [OR] 0·87, 95\% CI 0·84-0·91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·99, 95\% CI 0·88-1·11, p=0·85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·62, 95\% CI 0·58-0·66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·93 95\% CI 0·68-1·26, p=0·63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1·54, 95\% CI 1·45-1·63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2·13 95\% CI 1·69-2·69, p=2×10 -10). Interpretation Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.},

This conundrum presents a fundamental question: were the approaches used to raise HDL flawed or the protective effects of HDL are an epiphenomenon? Recent attempts to elevate plasma HDL were universally based on reducing HDL catabolism by blocking reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Here, we argue that this mode of HDL elevation may be mechanistically different to natural mechanisms and thus be counterproductive. We further argue that independently of whether HDL is a driving force or a surrogate measure of the rate of RCT, approaches aimed at increasing HDL supply, rather than reducing its catabolism, would be most beneficial for speeding up RCT and improving protection against CVD.},

Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) raises HDL cholesterol levels and might therefore improve cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS We randomly assigned 15,871 patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome to receive the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib, at a dose of 600 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to the best available evidence-based care. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. RESULTS At the time of randomization, the mean HDL cholesterol level was 42 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter), and the mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 76 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter). Over the course of the trial, HDL cholesterol levels increased from baseline by 4 to 11\% in the placebo group and by 31 to 40\% in the dalcetrapib group. Dalcetrapib had a minimal effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Patients were followed for a median of 31 months. At a prespecified interim analysis that included 1135 primary end-point events (71\% of the projected total number), the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial for futility. As compared with placebo, dalcetrapib did not alter the risk of the primary end point (cumulative event rate, 8.0\% and 8.3\%, respectively; hazard ratio with dalcetrapib, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.16; P=0.52) and did not have a significant effect on any component of the primary end point or total mortality. The median C-reactive protein level was 0.2 mg per liter higher and the mean systolic blood pressure was 0.6 mm Hg higher with dalcetrapib as compared with placebo (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS In patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome, dalcetrapib increased HDL cholesterol levels but did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. (Funded by F.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with established cardiovascular disease, residual cardiovascular risk persists despite the achievement of target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with statin therapy. It is unclear whether extended-release niacin added to simvastatin to raise low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is superior to simvastatin alone in reducing such residual risk. METHODS We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive extended-release niacin, 1500 to 2000 mg per day, or matching placebo. All patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe, 10 mg per day, if needed, to maintain an LDL cholesterol level of 40 to 80 mg per deciliter (1.03 to 2.07 mmol per liter). The primary end point was the first event of the composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome, or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization. RESULTS A total of 3414 patients were randomly assigned to receive niacin (1718) or placebo (1696). The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. At 2 years, niacin therapy had significantly increased the median HDL cholesterol level from 35 mg per deciliter (0.91 mmol per liter) to 42 mg per deciliter (1.08 mmol per liter), lowered the triglyceride level from 164 mg per deciliter (1.85 mmol per liter) to 122 mg per deciliter (1.38 mmol per liter), and lowered the LDL cholesterol level from 74 mg per deciliter (1.91 mmol per liter) to 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter). The primary end point occurred in 282 patients in the niacin group (16.4\%) and in 274 patients in the placebo group (16.2\%) (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.21; P=0.79 by the log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.81 mmol per liter), there was no incremental clinical benefit from the addition of niacin to statin therapy during a 36-month follow-up period, despite significant improvements in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

	abstract = {CONTEXT Associations of major lipids and apolipoproteins with the risk of vascular disease have not been reliably quantified. OBJECTIVE To assess major lipids and apolipoproteins in vascular risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Individual records were supplied on 302,430 people without initial vascular disease from 68 long-term prospective studies, mostly in Europe and North America. During 2.79 million person-years of follow-up, there were 8857 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 3928 coronary heart disease [CHD] deaths, 2534 ischemic strokes, 513 hemorrhagic strokes, and 2536 unclassified strokes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for several conventional factors, were calculated for 1-SD higher values: 0.52 log(e) triglyceride, 15 mg/dL high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 43 mg/dL non-HDL-C, 29 mg/dL apolipoprotein AI, 29 mg/dL apolipoprotein B, and 33 mg/dL directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Within-study regression analyses were adjusted for within-person variation and combined using meta-analysis. RESULTS The rates of CHD per 1000 person-years in the bottom and top thirds of baseline lipid distributions, respectively, were 2.6 and 6.2 with triglyceride, 6.4 and 2.4 with HDL-C, and 2.3 and 6.7 with non-HDL-C. Adjusted HRs for CHD were 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.05) with triglyceride, 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.74-0.82) with HDL-C, and 1.50 (95\% CI, 1.39-1.61) with non-HDL-C. Hazard ratios were at least as strong in participants who did not fast as in those who did. The HR for CHD was 0.35 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.42) with a combination of 80 mg/dL lower non-HDL-C and 15 mg/dL higher HDL-C. For the subset with apolipoproteins or directly measured LDL-C, HRs were 1.50 (95\% CI, 1.38-1.62) with the ratio non-HDL-C/HDL-C, 1.49 (95\% CI, 1.39-1.60) with the ratio apo B/apo AI, 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.91) with non-HDL-C, and 1.38 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.73) with directly measured LDL-C. Hazard ratios for ischemic stroke were 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.11) with triglyceride, 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.02) with HDL-C, and 1.12 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.20) with non-HDL-C. CONCLUSION Lipid assessment in vascular disease can be simplified by measurement of either total and HDL cholesterol levels or apolipoproteins without the need to fast and without regard to triglyceride.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Age, sex, and blood pressure could modify the associations of total cholesterol (and its main two fractions, HDL and LDL cholesterol) with vascular mortality. This meta-analysis combined prospective studies of vascular mortality that recorded both blood pressure and total cholesterol at baseline, to determine the joint relevance of these two risk factors. METHODS Information was obtained from 61 prospective observational studies, mostly in western Europe or North America, consisting of almost 900,000 adults without previous disease and with baseline measurements of total cholesterol and blood pressure. During nearly 12 million person years at risk between the ages of 40 and 89 years, there were more than 55,000 vascular deaths (34,000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 12,000 stroke, 10,000 other). Information about HDL cholesterol was available for 150,000 participants, among whom there were 5000 vascular deaths (3000 IHD, 1000 stroke, 1000 other). Reported associations are with usual cholesterol levels (ie, corrected for the regression dilution bias). FINDINGS 1 mmol/L lower total cholesterol was associated with about a half (hazard ratio 0.44 [95\% CI 0.42-0.48]), a third (0.66 [0.65-0.68]), and a sixth (0.83 [0.81-0.85]) lower IHD mortality in both sexes at ages 40-49, 50-69, and 70-89 years, respectively, throughout the main range of cholesterol in most developed countries, with no apparent threshold. The proportional risk reduction decreased with increasing blood pressure, since the absolute effects of cholesterol and blood pressure were approximately additive. Of various simple indices involving HDL cholesterol, the ratio total/HDL cholesterol was the strongest predictor of IHD mortality (40\% more informative than non-HDL cholesterol and more than twice as informative as total cholesterol). Total cholesterol was weakly positively related to ischaemic and total stroke mortality in early middle age (40-59 years), but this finding could be largely or wholly accounted for by the association of cholesterol with blood pressure. Moreover, a positive relation was seen only in middle age and only in those with below-average blood pressure; at older ages (70-89 years) and, particularly, for those with systolic blood pressure over about 145 mm Hg, total cholesterol was negatively related to haemorrhagic and total stroke mortality. The results for other vascular mortality were intermediate between those for IHD and stroke. INTERPRETATION Total cholesterol was positively associated with IHD mortality in both middle and old age and at all blood pressure levels. The absence of an independent positive association of cholesterol with stroke mortality, especially at older ages or higher blood pressures, is unexplained, and invites further research. Nevertheless, there is conclusive evidence from randomised trials that statins substantially reduce not only coronary event rates but also total stroke rates in patients with a wide range of ages and blood pressures.},

	abstract = {The lipoprotein HDL has two important roles: first, it promotes reverse cholesterol transport, and second, it modulates inflammation. Epidemiological studies show that HDL-cholesterol levels are inversely correlated with the risk of cardiovascular events. However, many patients who experience a clinical event have normal, or even high, levels of HDL cholesterol. Measuring HDL-cholesterol levels provides information about the size of the HDL pool, but does not predict HDL composition or function. The main component of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), is largely responsible for reverse cholesterol transport through the macrophage ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1. Apo A-I can be damaged by oxidative mechanisms, which render the protein less able to promote cholesterol efflux. HDL also contains a number of other proteins that are affected by the oxidative environment of the acute-phase response. Modification of the protein components of HDL can convert it from an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory particle. Small peptides that mimic some of the properties of apo A-I have been shown in preclinical models to improve HDL function and reduce atherosclerosis without altering HDL-cholesterol levels. Robust assays to evaluate the function of HDL are needed to supplement the measurement of HDL-cholesterol levels in the clinic.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collated from 40 long-term prospective studies involving a total of 87 474 participants and 10 625 incident CVD outcomes. In a comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the bottom third of baseline values of natriuretic peptides, the combined risk ratio (RR), adjusted for several conventional risk factors, was 2.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.40 to 3.33) for CVD. Analysis of the 6 studies with at least 250 CVD outcomes (which should be less prone to selective reporting than are smaller studies) yielded an adjusted RR of 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.57 to 2.39). RRs were broadly similar with BNP or NT-proBNP (RR, 2.89 [95\% CI, 1.91 to 4.38] and 2.82 [95\% CI, 2.35 to 3.38], respectively) and by different baseline vascular risk (RR, 2.68 [95\% CI, 2.07 to 3.47] in approximately general populations; RR, 3.35 [95\% CI, 2.38 to 4.72] in people with elevated vascular risk factors; RR, 2.60 [95\% CI, 1.99 to 3.38] in patients with stable CVD). Assay of BNP or NT-proBNP in addition to measurement of conventional CVD risk factors yielded generally modest improvements in risk discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Available prospective studies indicate strong associations between circulating concentration of natriuretic peptides and CVD risk under a range of different circumstances. Further investigation is warranted, particularly in large general population studies, to clarify any predictive utility of these markers and to better control for publication bias.},

In models adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors and renal function, galectin-3 was a significant predictor of CVD mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD log increase 1.30, 95\% CI 1.10-1.53) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.12, 1.01-1.24), but not coronary heart disease (HR 1.09, 0.92-1.30). After further adjusting for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, galectin-3 remained an independent predictor (HR 1.24, 1.05-1.47) of CVD mortality. Galectin-3 improved the c statistic (0.847-0.851, P =.003) for prediction of CVD death. Net reclassification improvement ({\textgreater}0) with the addition of galectin-3 was 35\% (P {\textless}0001) the integrated discrimination index was also significant (P =.03). Participants with both galectin-3 and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide above the median had increased risk of CVD death vs those with higher levels of only 1 of these markers (HR 1.74, 1.24-2.43). Conclusion Higher levels of galectin-3 are independently associated with all-cause and CVD mortality among community-dwelling older adults with no known CVD at baseline. ?? 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and soluble (s)ST2 are markers of cardiac and vascular stress. We investigated the associations between circulating concentrations of these biomarkers and incident stroke and subclinical vascular brain injury in a sample from the Framingham Offspring cohort. Methods - We followed 3374 stroke- and dementia-free individuals (mean age, 59.0+/-9.7 years; 53\% women) attending the Framingham Offspring sixth examination cycle 11.8+/-3.0 years for incident stroke. A subsample of 2463 individuals underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing =4.0+/-1.7 years after the sixth examination. Results - After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and urine albumin levels, higher stress biomarker levels were associated cross-sectionally with lower brain volumes (beta coefficients for intracranial volume comparing fourth [Q4] versus first biomarker [Q1] quartiles: -0.71\% for GDF-15; P=0.002 and 0.47\% for sST2; P=0.02) and worse performance on the visual reproduction test (beta coefficients for Q4 versus Q1: -0.62 for GDF-15; P=0.009 and -0.40 for sST2; P=0.04). Higher GDF-15 concentrations were also associated with greater log-transformed white-matter hyperintensity volumes (beta for Q4 versus Q1=0.19; P=0.01). Prospectively, a total of 203 (6\%) individuals developed incident stroke/transient ischemic attack during follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, sST2 remained significantly associated with stroke/transient ischemic attack, hazard ratio for Q4 versus Q1 of 1.76, 95\% confidence interval of 1.06 to 2.92, and P=0.03. Conclusions - Circulating GDF-15 and sST2 are associated with subclinical brain injury and cognitive impairment. Higher sST2 concentrations are also associated with incident stroke, suggesting potential links between cardiac stress biomarkers and brain injury.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular events in community-based populations have not consistently added information to standard risk factors. A limitation of many previously studied biomarkers is their lack of cardiovascular specificity. METHODS AND RESULTS To determine the prognostic value of 3 novel biomarkers induced by cardiovascular stress, we measured soluble ST2, growth differentiation factor-15, and high-sensitivity troponin I in 3428 participants (mean age, 59 years; 53\% women) in the Framingham Heart Study. We performed multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models to assess the individual and combined ability of the biomarkers to predict adverse outcomes. We also constructed a "multimarker" score composed of the 3 biomarkers in addition to B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. During a mean follow-up of 11.3 years, there were 488 deaths, 336 major cardiovascular events, 162 heart failure events, and 142 coronary events. In multivariable-adjusted models, the 3 new biomarkers were associated with each end point (P{\textless}0.001) except coronary events. Individuals with multimarker scores in the highest quartile had a 3-fold risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.2-4.7; P{\textless}0.001), 6-fold risk of heart failure (6.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.6-14.8; P{\textless}0.001), and 2-fold risk of cardiovascular events (1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7; P=0.001). Addition of the multimarker score to clinical variables led to significant increases in the c statistic (P=0.005 or lower) and net reclassification improvement (P=0.001 or lower). CONCLUSION Multiple biomarkers of cardiovascular stress are detectable in ambulatory individuals and add prognostic value to standard risk factors for predicting death, overall cardiovascular events, and heart failure.},

The serum of such rats exhibited precipitin reactions against trypsinized digests of isologous kidney and arterial tissues. The presence of anti-kidney and anti-artery components in the serum was also indicated by the binding of fluorescein-conjugated globulins to the glomerular and basement membranes and arterial components of normal kidney. Globulin was localized in the small arteries of kidneys exhibiting endarteritis and damage to the elastic membrane. Suppressants of antibody reactions (cortisone and 6-mercaptopurine) inhibited the development of hypertension following infarction of the kidney. The demonstration of the presence of anti-kidney components in the sera of certain patients with hypertension and those with renal disease suggests that this phenomena of an autoimmune reaction against renal tissue which has been induced experimentally in the rat may also play a role in human disorders.

	abstract = {Background Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing inflammation without affecting lipid levels may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Yet, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis has remained unproved. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, involving 10,061 patients with previous myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter. The trial compared three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3 months) with placebo. The primary efficacy end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Results At 48 months, the median reduction from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 26 percentage points greater in the group that received the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 percentage points greater in the 150-mg group, and 41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group than in the placebo group. Canakinumab did not reduce lipid levels from baseline. At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the incidence rate for the primary end point was 4.50 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events per 100 person-years in the 50-mg group, 3.86 events per 100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 events per 100 person-years in the 300-mg group. The hazard ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the 50-mg group, 0.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.07; P=0.30); in the 150-mg group, 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.021); and in the 300-mg group, 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P=0.031). The 150-mg dose, but not the other doses, met the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted threshold for statistical significance for the primary end point and the secondary end point that additionally included hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005). Canakinumab was associated with a higher incidence of fatal infection than was placebo. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio for all canakinumab doses vs. placebo, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P=0.31). Conclusions Antiinflammatory therapy targeting the interleukin-1β innate immunity pathway with canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo, independent of lipid-level lowering.

	abstract = {Chronic inflammation in the kidneys and vascular wall is a major contributor to hypertension. However, the stimuli and cellular mechanisms responsible for such inflammatory responses remain poorly defined. Inflammasomes are crucial initiators of sterile inflammation in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. These pattern recognition receptors detect host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as microcrystals and reactive oxygen species, and respond by inducing activation of caspase-1. Caspase-1 then processes the cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms thus triggering inflammation. While IL-1β and IL-18 are known to be elevated in hypertensive patients, no studies have examined whether this occurs downstream of inflammasome activation or whether inhibition of inflammasome and/or IL-1β/IL-18 signalling prevents hypertension. In this review, we will discuss some known actions of IL-1β and IL-18 on leukocyte and vessel wall function that could potentially underlie a prohypertensive role for these cytokines. We will describe the major classes of inflammasome-activating DAMPs and present evidence that at least some of these are elevated in the setting of hypertension. Finally, we will provide information on drugs that are currently used to inhibit inflammasome/IL-1β/IL-18 signalling and how these might ultimately be used as therapeutic agents for the clinical management of hypertension.},

However, the role of inflammatory processes in neurogenic hypertension remains to be determined. Thus, our objective in the present study was to test the hypothesis that activation of microglial cells and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) contribute to neurogenic hypertension. Intracerebroventricular infusion of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic, caused a significant attenuation of mean arterial pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and plasma norepinephrine induced by chronic angiotensin II infusion. This was associated with decreases in the numbers of activated microglia and mRNAs for interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and an increase in the mRNA for IL-10 in the PVN. Overexpression of IL-10 induced by recombinant adenoassociated virus-mediated gene transfer in the PVN mimicked the antihypertensive effects of minocycline. Furthermore, acute application of a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta, into the left ventricle or the PVN in normal rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure. Collectively, this indicates that angiotensin II induced hypertension involves activation of microglia and increases in proinflammatory cytokines in the PVN. These data have significant implications on the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for the control of neurogenic hypertension.},

The inflammasome is a large multimeric protein complex comprising an effector protein that demonstrates specificity for a variety of activators or ligands; an adaptor molecule; and procaspase-1, which is converted to caspase-1 upon inflammasome activation. Inflammasomes are expressed primarily by myeloid cells and are located within the cell. The macromolecular inflammasome structure can be visualized by cryo-electron microscopy. This complex has been found to play a role in a variety of disease models in mice, and several have been genetically linked to human diseases. In most cases, the effector protein is a member of the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing) or NOD (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptor protein family. However, other effectors have also been described, with the most notable being AIM-2 (absent in melanoma 2), which recognizes DNA to elicit inflammasome function.

	abstract = {Neuroimmunomodulation has experienced an explosive growth not only in basic research, but expanding to the point that prospective clinical research could be now a reality. A crucial factor for the functioning of this intimate bidirectional network was the demonstration that the immune and neuroendocrine systems speak a mutual biochemical language. This implies 1) production of neuroendocrine hormones and neuropeptides by immune cells and of cytokines by neuroendocrine cells; 2) evidence for shared receptors on cells of the immune and neuroendocrine systems; 3) effect of neuroendocrine mediators on immune functions; and 4) effect of cytokines on the neuroendocrine system. This reduces traditional differences between neurotransmitters, hormones, and immune mediators and raises the following question: what can we now regard as immune or neuroendocrine? Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one example of this paradigm. VIP has traditionally been classified as a neuropeptide/neurotransmitter based in its capacity to mediate and regulate neuronal functions. Recent work has demonstrated that VIP is produced by T cells, especially Th2 cells, and that through specific receptors it exerts immunological functions typically ascribed to Th2 cytokines in nervous and immune systems. Here, we postulate that instead of a neuropeptide, VIP could be fully considered a type 2 cytokine with a key role in neuroimmunology.},

	abstract = {Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system has long been implicated in the hypertensive response to elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. Although recent studies suggest that high dietary salt may alter cardiovascular responses to Ang II, direct evidence demonstrating chronic activation of sympathetic nerve activity is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of Ang II, on a background of high salt intake, would result in a chronic increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Arterial pressure and RSNA were recorded via telemetry. Two groups of rabbits were studied: 1 group drank a 0.9\% NaCl solution and received Ang II (20 ng/kg per minute for 21 days, Salt+Ang), and the other drank tap water throughout and was not infused with Ang II (Control). In the Salt+Ang group, mean arterial pressure increased over the first week and remain elevated by 18.5±4.1 mm Hg at day 21. RSNA was not significantly different between groups on day 7 but was significantly elevated in the Salt+Ang group on day 21 (13.5±3.2\% compared with 6.8±0.8\% in the Control group; P{\textless}0.05). Baroreflex control of RSNA showed a rightward shift on day 21, but not day 7, and baroreflex responses indicated that RSNA could not be completely suppressed when arterial pressure was increased. No changes were observed in either mean arterial pressure or RSNA variables in the Control group. Our results support the hypothesis that elevated Ang II levels, in conjunction with a high salt diet, have the ability to chronically increase RSNA and, thus, potentially contribute to the maintenance of hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess-treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets. RESULTS: We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of Bacteroides acidifaciens. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar effects and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective effects of high fiber and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal Egr1, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-Angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-Activated protein kinase signaling in the heart. CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The favorable effects of fiber may be explained by the generation and distribution of one of the main metabolites of the gut microbiota, the short-chain fatty acid acetate. Acetate effected several molecular changes associated with improved cardiovascular health and function.},

	abstract = {In salt-sensitive hypertension, the accumulation of Na+ in tissue has been presumed to be accompanied by a commensurate retention of water to maintain the isotonicity of body fluids. We show here that a high-salt diet (HSD) in rats leads to interstitial hypertonic Na+ accumulation in skin, resulting in increased density and hyperplasia of the lymphcapillary network. The mechanisms underlying these effects on lymphatics involve activation of tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) in mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) cells infiltrating the interstitium of the skin. TonEBP binds the promoter of the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C, encoded by Vegfc) and causes VEGF-C secretion by macrophages. MPS cell depletion or VEGF-C trapping by soluble VEGF receptor-3 blocks VEGF-C signaling, augments interstitial hypertonic volume retention, decreases endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and elevates blood pressure in response to HSD. Our data show that TonEBP-VEGF-C signaling in MPS cells is a major determinant of extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis and identify VEGFC as an osmosensitive, hypertonicity-driven gene intimately involved in salt-induced hypertension.},

	abstract = {Background: This study investigates the plasma activity of inflammatory mediators such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C-C chemokines and soluble adhesion molecules, produced by monocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interaction, in patients with arterial hypertension. Methods: We studied 66 untreated patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension (hypercholesterolemic: 34, normocholesterolemic: 32) and 30 sex- and age-matched normocholesterolemic normotensive controls. Plasma concentrations of GM-CSF, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), RANTES (regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), as well as plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), were determined in study population by ELISA and RIA, respectively. Results: Hypertensives exhibited significantly higher levels of GM-CSF (6.5±1.3 vs. 2.3±0.7 pg/ml, P=0.099), MCP-1 (175±31 vs. 120±24 pg/ml, P=0.0093), MIP-1α (23±4 vs. 15±2 pg/ml, P=0.0089), RANTES (17±4 vs. 14±3 ng/ml, P=0.047), sICAM-1 (235±39 vs. 187±21 ng/ml, P=0.0041), sVCAM-1 (684±42 vs. 589±23 ng/ml, P=0.0045) and ET-1 (6.1±1.5 vs. 2.4±0.3 pg/ml, P=0.0095) than those of normotensives. The normocholesterolemic hypertensives had significantly lower levels of GM-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 than hypercholesterolemic hypertensives but higher than normotensives. In hypertensives, ET-1 levels were significantly correlated with mean arterial pressure (r=0.51, P=0.028), MCP-1 values (r=0.45, P=0.047) and sICAM-1 levels (r=0.64, P=0.0090). Significant correlations were also found between LDL cholesterol values and plasma inflammatory factors GM-CSF (r=0.58, P=0.0088), MCP-1 (r=0.49, P=0.040) and sICAM-1 (r=0.53, P=0.034) in the hypercholesterolemic sub-group of hypertensives. Conclusions: Inflammatory markers of monocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interaction are elevated in hypertensives in comparison to normotensives and may be related to plasma ET-1 activity. The coexistence of hypercholesterolemia may enhance this inflammatory process induced by arterial hypertension. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A (CsA) has emerged as an important new cause of hypertension in both organ transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases. Despite the clinical importance of this hypertension, the underlying mechanisms have been enigmatic. This article presents a conceptual framework for understanding the pathophysiologic basis of CsA-induced hypertension and focuses on the hypothesis that a common molecular mechanism is involved in mediating the immunosuppressive and the hypertensive effects of CsA. This mechanism involves the binding of CsA to a newly discovered class of cytoplasmic receptors (termed 'immunophilins') not only in T lymphocytes but also in the kidney, vascular smooth muscle, and central nervous system, which are the main target tissues mediating CsA-induced hypertension. Binding of CsA to its receptor leads to inhibition of calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase. Evidence is reviewed to support the hypothesis that calcineurin inhibition plays a pivotal role in mediating both CsA-induced immunosuppression and hypertension, the latter being produced at least in part by sympathetic neural activation. The elucidation of novel CsA-sensitive cellular signaling pathways has lead to the search for the ideal immunosuppressant drug, one which retains CsA's immunosuppressive efficacy but without its toxicity.},

	abstract = {Background: Blood pressure (BP) variability has been reported to be associated with hypertensive target organ damage and cardiovascular events. However, the exact mechanism linking BP variability and organ damage is uncertain. This study was designed to investigate the association between BP variability and inflammatory marker in hypertensive patients. Methods and Results: Fifty-two hypertensive patients (28 men, 55.9±1.5 years) completed 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. Inflammatory markers were evaluated by measuring plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) by particle-enhanced light-scattering immunoassay. BP variability was obtained by calculating within-subject standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation of BP. Subjects were grouped into fertiles according to IL-6, TNF-α, and hs-CRP levels. A significant association between ambulatory BP and TNF-α level was identified (P for trend=0.011). In contrast, no association was observed between BP and IL-6 level; however, BP variability index was linked to IL-6 level (P for trend =0.046). The association between inflammatory marker and pattern of diurnal variation was investigated. The hs-CRP concentration was significantly higher in the riser group compared with the dipper group. However, IL-6 and TNF-α levels did not differ among the different diurnal variation groups. Correlation analysis showed varying associations between IL-6 and TNF-α. TNF-α level correlated with the BP index; however, IL-6 level correlated with the BP variability index. Multiple linear regression models revealed that the SD of daytime systolic BP (β=0.065, p=0.001) and age (β=0.024, p=0.016) were all positively and significantly related to IL-6. In contrast, only daytime diastolic BP (β=0.029, p=0.002) was independently related to TNF-α. Conclusion: Inflammatory markers are associated with BP variability in hypertensive patients. This finding implies that inflammation may be a mediator for the link between BP variability and target organ damage.},

Immunosuppressive therapy, including glucocorticoids, has been implicated in accelerating atherosclerosis and increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatic diseases or solid organ transplant recipients. Areas covered: Literature review conducted with the use of PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane library for peer reviewed articles then stratified for strength of evidence in reference to traditional risk factors such as hypertension, lipid profile and insulin resistance. Evidence of cardiovascular events were included. Commonly used immunosuppressive agent used in the treatment of IED including azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and the biologics. Each immunosuppressive agent was considered in terms of effects on hypertension, lipid profile, insulin resistance and cardiovascular outcomes. Expert commentary: Cyclosporine is associated with increased risk of hypertension and tacrolimus with insulin resistance. There is little evidence of cardiovascular disease with the use of methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate. There is some evidence that the newer biologics may have protective effects on cardiovascular parameters. However, there is heterogeneity of the study populations and limited evidence in the ophthalmological setting.},

Incidents were more likely to be reported to the police when they had characteristics that made them more "believable" (e.g., presence of a weapon or assailant who was a stranger).

	abstract = {Emerging data indicate a correlation between gut microbial composition and cardiovascular disease including hypertension. The host’s diet greatly affects microbial composition and metabolite production. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are products of microbial fermentation, which can be utilized by the host. It has been suggested that SCFAs play a pivotal role as mediators in a microbiome host: microbial interactions occur in health and disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high salt diet (HSD) on microbial variation and to determine whether this effect is accompanied by an alteration in fecal SCFAs. To this end, Dahl salt-sensitive rats were divided into two groups (n = 10 each): (A) Control: fed regular chow; and (B) Fed HSD. High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used for microbiome characterizing. Chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the levels of SCFAs: acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid in fecal samples. Differences in microbial composition were noted between groups. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) principal coordinate 1 (PC1) primarily separated controls from the HSD. Four taxa displayed significant differences between HSD and controls. Taxa from the Erwinia genus, the Christensenellaceae and Corynebacteriaceae families, displayed an increased abundance in HSD versus control. In contrast, taxa from the Anaerostipes genus displayed a decreased abundance in HSD. We were able to identify seven unique taxa that were significantly associated with blood pressure. There was a significant difference in fecal acetic acid, as well as propionic and isobutyric acid, but not in the butyric acid composition between groups. Adding salt to a diet impacts the gut’s microbial composition, which may alter fecal SCFA production.},

However, growing evidence suggests that the immune system can play surprising roles in sodium homeostasis, such that the study of inflammatory cells and their secreted effectors has provided important insights into salt sensitivity. As part of the innate immune system, myeloid cells have diverse roles in blood pressure regulation, ranging from prohypertensive actions in the kidney, vasculature, and brain, to effects in the skin that attenuate blood pressure elevation. In parallel, T lymphocyte subsets, as key constituents of the adaptive immune compartment, have variable effects on renal sodium handling and the hypertensive response, accruing from the functions of the cytokines that they produce. Conversely, salt can directly modulate the phenotypes of myeloid and T cells, illustrating bidirectional regulatory mechanisms through which sodium and the immune system coordinately impact blood pressure.

	abstract = {Low-grade inflammation drives elevations in blood pressure (BP) and consequent target organ damage in diverse experimental models of hypertension. Here, we discuss recent advances elucidating immune-mediated mechanisms of BP elevation and associated target organ damage. Inflammatory mediators produced by immune cells or target organs act on the kidney, vasculature, skin, and nervous system to modulate hypertension. For example, cells of the innate immune system, including monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs), can all promote BP elevation via actions in the vasculature and kidney. Macrophages expressing VEGF-C impact non-osmotic sodium storage in the skin that in turn regulates salt sensitivity. Within the adaptive immune system, activated T cells can secrete tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-17a (IL-17a), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), each of which has augmented BP and renal damage in pre-clinical models. Inversely, deficiency of IL-17a in mice blunts the hypertensive response and attenuates renal sodium retention via a serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1)–dependent pathway. Linking innate and adaptive immune responses, dendritic cells activated by augmented extracellular sodium concentrations stimulate T lymphocytes to produce pro-hypertensive cytokines. By contrast, regulatory T cells (Tregs) can protect against hypertension and associated kidney injury. Rodent studies reveal diverse mechanisms via which cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems drive blood pressure elevation by altering the inflammatory milieu in the kidney, vasculature, and brain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Optimal drug treatment for patients with resistant hypertension is undefined. We aimed to test the hypotheses that resistant hypertension is most often caused by excessive sodium retention, and that spironolactone would therefore be superior to non-diuretic add-on drugs at lowering blood pressure. 

METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we enrolled patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater (or ≥135 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and home systolic blood pressure (18 readings over 4 days) 130 mm Hg or greater, despite treatment for at least 3 months with maximally tolerated doses of three drugs, from 12 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Patients rotated, in a preassigned, randomised order, through 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of spironolactone (25–50 mg), bisoprolol (5–10 mg), doxazosin modified release (4–8 mg), and placebo, in addition to their baseline blood pressure drugs. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Investigators and patients were masked to the identity of drugs, and to their sequence allocation. The dose was doubled after 6 weeks of each cycle. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in averaged home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed (if significant) by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, followed by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with EudraCT number 2008-007149-30, and ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02369081. 

FINDINGS
Between May 15, 2009, and July 8, 2014, we screened 436 patients, of whom 335 were randomly assigned. After 21 were excluded, 285 patients received spironolactone, 282 doxazosin, 285 bisoprolol, and 274 placebo; 230 patients completed all treatment cycles. The average reduction in home systolic blood pressure by spironolactone was superior to placebo (–8·70 mm Hg [95\% CI −9·72 to −7·69]; p{\textless}0·0001), superior to the mean of the other two active treatments (doxazosin and bisoprolol; −4·26 [–5·13 to −3·38]; p{\textless}0·0001), and superior when compared with the individual treatments; versus doxazosin (–4·03 [–5·04 to −3·02]; p{\textless}0·0001) and versus bisoprolol (–4·48 [–5·50 to −3·46]; p{\textless}0·0001). Spironolactone was the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment, throughout the distribution of baseline plasma renin; but its margin of superiority and likelihood of being the best drug for the individual patient were many-fold greater in the lower than higher ends of the distribution. All treatments were well tolerated. In six of the 285 patients who received spironolactone, serum potassium exceeded 6·0 mmol/L on one occasion. 

INTERPRETATION
Spironolactone was the most effective add-on drug for the treatment of resistant hypertension. The superiority of spironolactone supports a primary role of sodium retention in this condition.

Low-grade inflammation plays a key role in hypertension and the innate and adaptive immune systems seem to contribute to hypertension development and maintenance. Hypertension is associated with vascular inflammation, increased vascular cytokines levels and infiltration of immune cells in the vasculature, kidneys and heart. However, the mechanisms that trigger inflammation and immune system activation in hypertension are completely unknown. Cells from the innate immune system express pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that induce innate effector mechanisms to produce endogenous signals, such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, to alert the host about danger. Additionally, antigen-presenting cells (APC) act as sentinels that are activated by PAMPs and DAMPs to sense the presence of the antigen/neoantigen, which ensues the adaptive immune system activation. In this context, different lymphocyte types are activated and contribute to inflammation and end-organ damage in hypertension. This review will focus on experimental and clinical evidence demonstrating the contribution of the innate and adaptive immune systems to the development of hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Persistent inflammation has been proposed to contribute to various stages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades. To assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect IL6R signalling. METHODS In a collaborative meta-analysis, we studied Asp358Ala (rs2228145) in IL6R in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants. We also compared the frequency of Asp358Ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls. To gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed Asp358Ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6. FINDINGS The minor allele frequency of Asp358Ala was 39\%. Asp358Ala was not associated with lipid concentrations, blood pressure, adiposity, dysglycaemia, or smoking (p value for association per minor allele ≥0·04 for each). By contrast, for every copy of 358Ala inherited, mean concentration of IL6R increased by 34·3\% (95\% CI 30·4-38·2) and of interleukin 6 by 14·6\% (10·7-18·4), and mean concentration of C-reactive protein was reduced by 7·5\% (5·9-9·1) and of fibrinogen by 1·0\% (0·7-1·3). For every copy of 358Ala inherited, risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 3·4\% (1·8-5·0). Asp358Ala was not related to IL6R mRNA levels or interleukin-6 production in monocytes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between resting blood pressure (BP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a multi-ethnic cohort of men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). BACKGROUND Several investigators have observed elevated levels of CRP in individuals with hypertension. Hypertension prevalence varies considerably across ethnic groups. Important questions remain regarding whether the relationship between hypertension and CRP is similar across ethnic and gender subgroups. METHODS The MESA participants had CRP levels determined at the baseline clinical examination (N = 6,814). Hypertension, treated as a dichotomous variable (yes/no), was defined as a systolic or diastolic BP {\textgreater} or =140/90 mm Hg or a self-reported history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications. RESULTS The geometric mean CRP in hypertensive participants was 2.3 +/- 0.07 mg/l compared with 1.6 +/- 0.07 mg/l among normotensive participants (p {\textless} 0.0001). The relative difference in CRP levels in hypertensives compared with normotensives was similar regardless of gender (13\% in men and 13\% in women). Ethnic comparisons showed that Chinese participants had the lowest CRP concentration but the largest difference in CRP by hypertension status (24\%). Caucasians and African Americans had 10\% to 15\% higher CRP levels with hypertension, whereas Hispanics had no significant difference in CRP by hypertension status. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the existence of an independent association between hypertension and inflammation in both men and women. Ethnic group differences were evident, with the strongest association observed in Chinese participants and no difference in CRP levels by hypertension status in Hispanics.},

	abstract = {Activation of TLRs (Toll-like receptors) induces gene expression of proteins involved in the immune system response. TLR4 has been implicated in the development and progression of CVDs (cardio-vascular diseases). Innate and adaptive immunity contribute to hypertension-associated end-organ damage, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. In the present study, we hypothesize that inhibition of TLR4 decreases BP (blood pressure) and improves vascular contractility in resistance arteries from SHR (spontaneously hypertensive rats). TLR4 protein expression in mesenteric resistance arteries was higher in 15-week-old SHR than in age-matched Wistar controls or in 5-week-old SHR. To decrease the activation of TLR4, 15-week-old SHR and Wistar rats were treated with anti-TLR4 (anti-TLR4 antibody) or non-specific IgG control antibody for 15 days (1 μg per day, intraperitoneal). Treatment with anti-TLR4 decreased MAP (mean arterial pressure) as well as TLR4 protein expression in mesenteric resistance arteries and IL-6 (interleukin 6) serum levels from SHR when compared with SHR treated with IgG. No changes in these parameters were found in treated Wistar control rats. Mesenteric resistance arteries from anti-TLR4-treated SHR exhibited decreased maximal contractile response to NA (noradrenaline) compared with IgG-treated SHR. Inhibition of COX (cyclo-oxygenase)-1 and COX-2, enzymes related to inflammatory pathways, decreased NA responses only in mesenteric resistance arteries of SHR treated with IgG. COX-2 expression and TXA2 (thromboxane A2) release were decreased in SHR treated with anti-TLR4 compared with IgG-treated SHR. Our results suggest that TLR4 activation contributes to increased BP, low-grade inflammation and plays a role in the augmented vascular contractility displayed by SHR.},

Medof and colleagues demonstrate that an absence of complement signaling in naive T cells generates an autoinductive loop to drive induced regulatory T cells. Signaling through the G protein–coupled receptors for the complement fragments C3a and C5a (C3aR and C5aR, respectively) by dendritic cells and CD4+ cells provides costimulatory and survival signals to effector T cells. Here we found that when signals from C3aR and C5aR were not transduced into CD4+ cells, signaling via the kinases PI(3)Kγ, Akt and mTOR ceased, activation of the kinase PKA increased, autoinductive signaling by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) initiated and CD4+ T cells became Foxp3+ induced regulatory T cells (iTreg cells). Endogenous TGF-β1 suppressed signaling through C3aR and C5aR by preventing the production of C3a and C5a and upregulating C5L2, an alternative receptor for C5a. The absence of signaling via C3aR and C5aR resulted in lower expression of costimulatory molecules and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and more production of IL-10. The resulting iTreg cells exerted robust suppression, had enhanced stability and suppressed ongoing autoimmune disease. Antagonism of C3aR and C5aR can also induce functional human iTreg cells.},

Patients with MH had a significantly elevated secretion of IgG and IgA as compared with C. Total serum concentration of lgs did not differ between the groups, but a raised level of the subclass IgG3 was found in MH. There was a significant positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and secretion of IgA and IgG when all hypertensive patients were studied. Six patients were subjected to repeated investigations during the first year after malignant phase. If examined in an early phase of MH (within 4 months) the secretion of IgG, IgA and IgM was enhanced compared with later stages (after 5-12 months). The results suggest that an immunological process is involved in MH.

	abstract = {RATIONALE Aortic stiffening commonly occurs in hypertension and further elevates systolic pressure. Hypertension is also associated with vascular inflammation and increased mechanical stretch. The interplay between inflammation, mechanical stretch, and aortic stiffening in hypertension remains undefined. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine the role of inflammation and mechanical stretch in aortic stiffening. METHODS AND RESULTS Chronic angiotensin II infusion caused marked aortic adventitial collagen deposition, as quantified by Masson trichrome blue staining and biochemically by hydroxyproline content, in wild-type but not in recombination activating gene-1-deficient mice. Aortic compliance, defined by ex vivo measurements of stress-strain curves, was reduced by chronic angiotensin II infusion in wild-type mice (P{\textless}0.01) but not in recombination activating gene-1-deficient mice (P{\textless}0.05). Adoptive transfer of T-cells to recombination activating gene-1-deficient mice restored aortic collagen deposition and stiffness to values observed in wild-type mice. Mice lacking the T-cell-derived cytokine interleukin 17a were also protected against aortic stiffening. In additional studies, we found that blood pressure normalization by treatment with hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide prevented angiotensin II-induced vascular T-cell infiltration, aortic stiffening, and collagen deposition. Finally, we found that mechanical stretch induces the expression of collagen 1α1, 3α1, and 5a1 in cultured aortic fibroblasts in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent fashion, and that inhibition of p38 prevented angiotensin II-induced aortic stiffening in vivo. Interleukin 17a also induced collagen 3a1 expression via the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. CONCLUSIONS Our data define a pathway in which inflammation and mechanical stretch lead to vascular inflammation that promotes collagen deposition. The resultant increase in aortic stiffness likely further worsens systolic hypertension and its attendant end-organ damage.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin (Ang) II promotes renal infiltration by immunocompetent cells in double-transgenic rats (dTGRs) harboring both human renin and angiotensinogen genes. To elucidate disease mechanisms, we investigated whether or not dexamethasone (DEXA) immunosuppression ameliorates renal damage. Untreated dTGRs developed hypertension, renal damage, and 50\% mortality at 7 weeks. DEXA reduced albuminuria, renal fibrosis, vascular reactive oxygen stress, and prevented mortality, independent of blood pressure. In dTGR kidneys, p22phox immunostaining co-localized with macrophages and partially with T cells. dTGR dendritic cells expressed major histocompatibility complex II and CD86, indicating maturation. DEXA suppressed major histocompatibility complex II+, CD86+, dendritic, and T-cell infiltration. In additional experiments, we treated dTGRs with mycophenolate mofetil to inhibit T- and B-cell proliferation. Reno-protective actions of mycophenolate mofetil and its effect on dendritic and T cells were similar to those obtained with DEXA. We next investigated whether or not Ang II directly promotes dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Ang II did not alter CD80, CD83, and MHC II expression, but increased CCR7 expression and cell migration. To explore the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α on dendritic cell maturation in vivo, we treated dTGRs with the soluble TNF-α receptor etanercept. This treatment had no effect on blood pressure, but decreased albuminuria, nuclear factor-κB activation, and infiltration of all immunocompetent cells. These data suggest that immunosuppression prevents dendritic cell maturation and T-cell infiltration in a nonimmune model of Ang II-induced renal damage. Ang II induces dendritic migration directly, whereas in vivo TNF-α is involved in dendritic cell infiltration and maturation. Thus, Ang II may initiate events leading to innate and acquired immune response.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The development of ANG II-dependent hypertension involves increased infiltration of macrophages (MΦ) and T cells into the kidney and the consequent elevation of intrarenal cytokines including IL-6, which facilitates the progression of hypertension and associated kidney injury. Intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, including proximal tubular angiotensinogen (AGT) stimulation, has also been regarded as a cardinal mechanism contributing to these diseases. However, the interaction between immune cells and intrarenal RAS activation has not been fully delineated. Therefore, the present study investigated whether ANG II-treated MΦ induce AGT upregulation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs). MΦ were treated with 0–10 $^{\textrm{−6}}$ M ANG II for up to 48 h. PTCs were incubated with the collected medium from MΦ. In ANG II-treated MΦ, IL-6 mRNA and protein levels were increased (1.86 ± 0.14, protein level, ratio to control); moreover, IL-6 levels were higher than TNF-α and IL-1β in culture medium isolated from ANG II-treated MΦ. Elevated AGT expression (1.69 ± 0.04, ratio to control) accompanied by phosphorylated STAT3 were observed in PTCs that received culture medium from ANG II-treated MΦ. The addition of a neutralizing IL-6 antibody to the collected medium attenuated phosphorylation of STAT3 and AGT augmentation in PTCs. Furthermore, a JAK2 inhibitor also suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation and AGT augmentation in PTCs. These results demonstrate that ANG II-induced IL-6 elevation in MΦ enhances activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and consequent AGT upregulation in PTCs, suggesting involvement of an immune response in driving intrarenal RAS activity. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Higher body mass index was related to underreporting of sodium. Calibration equations for true intake that included personal characteristics provided improved prediction, except for sodium density. In summary, self-reports capture potassium intake quite well but sodium intake less well. Using densities improves the measurement of potassium and sodium on an FFQ. Sodium:potassium ratio is measured much better than sodium itself on both FFQs and 24HRs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The association between salt intake and blood pressure levels is still inconclusive, and may be influenced by patient characteristics. We thus conducted a community-based cross-sectional study. METHODS This study included 2297 subjects aged ≥ 40 years not on antihypertensive medication at the time of a health check-up. We examined the association between blood pressure levels and the estimated amount of 24-h urinary sodium excretion (e24hUNa) stratified by background characteristics. The 24-h urinary excretion levels of sodium and potassium were estimated from Kawasaki's equation using a spot urine sample. RESULTS The association of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with e24hUNa was significantly positive in a multiple linear regression model adjusted for confounders including age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, renal function, and potassium excretion. The regression coefficients of changes in SBP and DBP per 1 SD increase in e24hUNa (53 mEq/day) were + 1.91 mmHg and + 0.94 mmHg, respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the increase in SBP was especially greater in the elderly, in subjects with diabetes, and in subjects with reduced renal function compared to those in the counterparts. The association between SBP and e24hUNa was insignificant in subjects with eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73m2, while the association with progression of renal dysfunction was stronger and significant. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrated that the association between blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion was strengthened by characteristics of subjects such as aging, presence of diabetes, and renal impairment in the community-based population.},

	abstract = {Excessive dietary salt (sodium chloride) intake is associated with an increased risk for hypertension, which in turn is especially a major risk factor for stroke and other cardiovascular pathologies, but also kidney diseases. Besides, high salt intake or preference for salty food is discussed to be positive associated with stomach cancer, and according to recent studies probably also obesity risk. On the other hand a reduction of dietary salt intake leads to a considerable reduction in blood pressure, especially in hypertensive patients but to a lesser extent also in normotensives as several meta-analyses of interventional studies have shown. Various mechanisms for salt-dependent hypertension have been put forward including volume expansion, modified renal functions and disorders in sodium balance, impaired reaction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and the associated receptors, central stimulation of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and possibly also inflammatory processes.Not every person reacts to changes in dietary salt intake with alterations in blood pressure, dividing people in salt sensitive and insensitive groups. It is estimated that about 50-60 \% of hypertensives are salt sensitive. In addition to genetic polymorphisms, salt sensitivity is increased in aging, in black people, and in persons with metabolic syndrome or obesity. However, although mechanisms of salt-dependent hypertensive effects are increasingly known, more research on measurement, storage and kinetics of sodium, on physiological properties, and genetic determinants of salt sensitivity are necessary to harden the basis for salt reduction recommendations.Currently estimated dietary intake of salt is about 9-12 g per day in most countries of the world. These amounts are significantly above the WHO recommended level of less than 5 g salt per day. According to recent research results a moderate reduction of daily salt intake from current intakes to 5-6 g can reduce morbidity rates. Potential risks of salt reduction, like suboptimal iodine supply, are limited and manageable. Concomitant to salt reduction, potassium intake by higher intake of fruits and vegetables should be optimised, since several studies have provided evidence that potassium rich diets or interventions with potassium can lower blood pressure, especially in hypertensives.In addition to dietary assessment the gold standard for measuring salt intake is the analysis of sodium excretion in the 24 h urine. Spot urine samples are appropriate alternatives for monitoring sodium intake. A weakness of dietary evaluations is that the salt content of many foods is not precisely known and information in nutrient databases are limited. A certain limitation of the urine assessment is that dietary sources contributing to salt intake cannot be identified.Salt reduction strategies include nutritional education, improving environmental conditions (by product reformulation and optimization of communal catering) up to mandatory nutrition labeling and regulated nutrition/health claims, as well as legislated changes in the form of taxation.Regarding dietary interventions for the reduction of blood pressure the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can be recommended. In addition, body weight should be normalized in overweight and obese people (BMI less than 25 kg/m2), salt intake should not exceed 5 g/day according to WHO recommendations ({\textless}2 g sodium/day), no more than 1.5 g sodium/d in blacks, middle- and older-aged persons, and individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, intake of potassium ({\textasciitilde}4.7 g/day) should be increased and alcohol consumption limited. In addition, regular physical activity (endurance, dynamic resistance, and isometric resistance training) is very important.},

A reduction in dietary sodium not only decreases the blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension, but is also associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Prolonged modest reduction in salt intake induces a relevant fall in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group, with larger falls in systolic blood pressure for larger reductions in dietary salt. The high sodium intake and the increase in blood pressure levels are related to water retention, increase in systemic peripheral resistance, alterations in the endothelial function, changes in the structure and function of large elastic arteries, modification in sympathetic activity, and in the autonomic neuronal modulation of the cardiovascular system. In this review, we have focused on the effects of sodium intake on vascular hemodynamics and their implication in the pathogenesis of hypertension.},

Its prevalence in Spain is high, especially in elderly individuals with comorbidity and chronic diseases. In cardiovascular disease, frailty is associated worse clinical outcomes and higher morbidity and mortality in all scenarios, in both acute and chronic settings, and could consequently influence diagnosis and treatment. However, frailty is often not addressed or included when planning the management of elderly patients with heart disease. In this article, we review the available scientific evidence and highlight the most appropriate scales for the measurement and assessment of frailty, some of which are more useful and have better predictive capacity than others, depending on the clinical context. We also underline the importance of properly identifying and assessing frailty in order to include it in the treatment and care plan that best suits each patient.

Many challenges exist in the assessment and management of HF in geriatric patients, who often have coexisting multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive impairment, and frailty. These complex “geriatric domains” greatly affect physical and functional status as well as long-term clinical outcomes. Geriatric patients have been under-represented in major HF clinical trials. Nonetheless, available data suggest that guideline-based medical and device therapies improve morbidity and mortality. Nonpharmacologic strategies, such as exercise training and dietary interventions, are an active area of research. Targeted geriatric evaluation, including functional and cognitive assessment, can improve risk stratification and guide management in older patients with HF. Clinical trials that enroll older patients with multiple morbidities and HF and evaluate functional status and quality of life in addition to mortality and cardiovascular morbidity should be encouraged to guide management of this age group.},

For these reasons, a threshold to define ‘elderly’ has been intentionally avoided in this document. Of note, over one third of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and two thirds dying from MI are over 75 years, but {\textless}7\% of patients in ACS trials are reported ≥75 years.11 Older patients have multi-organ changes, increased risk of both bleeding and ischaemic events,3,5,12 frequent comorbidities/comedication, and reduced adherence to prescriptions.

As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older patients typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a detailed review of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older patients. We found that there is a pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision making in older patients with car-diovascular disease, as well as a paucity of data on the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on key outcomes that are particularly important to older patients, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older patients representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older patients in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older patients, thereby enhancing patient-centered evidence-based care of older people with cardiovascular disease in the United States and around the world.

Optimal management of the older cardiac patient requires that these differences be taken into account. In prescribing a medical regimen, it is important to keep in mind that age-related decreases in renal function, hepatic perfusion, and drug metabolism may result in higher drug levels and that the elderly are also often more prone to adverse drug effects, especially central nervous system changes.

However, randomized trial results can be compromised by lack of representativeness. We aimed to assess the representativeness of the PARADIGM-HF trial in a real-world population of patients with heart failure. METHODS We reviewed the records of 196 outpatients followed in a heart failure clinic between January 2013 and December 2014. After exclusion of 44 patients with preserved ejection fraction, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial were applied. RESULTS Of the 152 patients with systolic heart failure, 106 lacked one or more inclusion criteria and 45 had at least one exclusion criterion. Considering only patients with ejection fraction ≤35\% (HFrEF) (n=88), 43 patients lacked at least one inclusion criterion and 25 patients had at least one exclusion criterion. Combining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24.3\% of patients with systolic HF (ejection fraction ≤50\%) and 42\% of patients with HFrEF would be eligible for the PARADIGM-HF trial. CONCLUSION One in four patients with systolic HF followed in a heart failure outpatient clinic would fulfill the reference study criteria for treatment with the new drug, sacubitril/valsartan.},

	abstract = {In the United States, the octogenarian population is projected to triple by 2050. With this aging population, the prevalence of valvular heart disease (VHD) is on the rise. The etiology, approach to treatment, and expected outcomes of VHD are different in the elderly compared with younger patients. Both stenotic and regurgitant lesions are associated with unfavorable outcomes if left untreated. Surgical mortality remains high due to multiple co-morbidities, and long-term survival benefit is dependent on many variables including valvular pathology. Quality of life is an important consideration in treatment decisions in this age group. Increasingly, octogenarian patients are receiving transcatheter therapies, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement having the greatest momentum. Numerous transcatheter devices for management of other valve lesions are currently in early clinical trials. This review will describe the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for VHD in the oldest old, with a focus on transcatheter technologies.},

	abstract = {Frailty is a geriatric syndrome of increased vulnerability to stressors that has been implicated as a causative and prognostic factor in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The American Heart Association and the Society of Geriatric Cardiology have called for a better understanding of frailty as it pertains to cardiac care in the elderly. The aim of this study was to systematically review studies of frailty in patients with CVD. A search was conducted of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, and unpublished sources. Inclusion criteria were an assessment of frailty using systematically defined criteria and a study population with prevalent or incident CVD. Nine studies were included, encompassing 54,250 elderly patients with a mean weighted follow-up of 6.2 years. In community-dwelling elders, CVD was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.7 to 4.1 for prevalent frailty and an OR of 1.5 for incident frailty in those who were not frail at baseline. Gait velocity (a measure of frailty) was associated with an OR of 1.6 for incident CVD. In elderly patients with documented severe coronary artery disease or heart failure, the prevalence of frailty was 50\% to 54\%, and this was associated with an OR of 1.6 to 4.0 for all-cause mortality after adjusting for potential confounders. In conclusion, there exists a relation between frailty and CVD; frailty may lead to CVD, just as CVD may lead to frailty. The presence of frailty confers an incremental increase in mortality. The role of frailty assessment in clinical practice may be to refine estimates of cardiovascular risk, which tend to be less accurate in the heterogenous elderly patient population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future; accordingly, cardiologists are encountering patients with a greater number of comorbid illnesses as well as “geriatric conditions,” such as cognitive impairment and frailty, which complicate management and influence outcomes. Simultaneously, technological advances have widened the therapeutic options available for patients, including those with the most advanced CV disease. In the setting of these changes, geriatric cardiology has recently emerged as a discipline that aims to adapt principles from geriatric medicine to everyday cardiology practice. Accordingly, the tasks of a “geriatric cardiologist” may include both traditional evidence-based CV management plus comprehensive geriatric assessment, medication reduction, team-based coordination of care, and explicit incorporation of patient goals into management. Given that the field is still in its relative infancy, the training pathways and structure of clinical programs in geriatric cardiology are still being delineated. In this review, we highlight the rationale behind geriatric cardiology as a discipline, several current approaches by geriatric cardiology programs, and future directions for the field.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and prognosis of ECG abnormalities in hypertensive individuals.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: ECG, blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors were recorded in a nationwide population sample of 5800 Finns. The presence of 15 ECG abnormalities was evaluated. Participants were divided into categories by blood pressure and followed for coronary heart (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Mean follow-up was 10.4 ± 2.2 years. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of ECG abnormalities were generally higher in the hypertensive participants than in normotensive individuals. In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, the following ECG abnormalities predicted CHD in hypertensive participants: left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by Sokolow-Lyon criteria [hazard ratio, 1.47; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.01; P = 0.02], LVH with ST-depression and negative T wave (ST/T changes) (hazard ratio, 2.31; 95\% CI, 1.20-4.43, P = 0.01), ST/T changes (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95\% CI, 1.34-3.36; P = 0.001), positive T wave in lead aVR (AVRT+) (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95\% CI, 1.15-2.64; P = 0.009) and poor R-wave progression (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95\% CI, 1.27-3.22; P = 0.003). These ECG abnormalities were also significant predictors of CVD in hypertensive participants (P ≤ 0.03 for all). Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay predicted CVD in the whole population (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.13; P = 0.02). Prolonged QT interval, abnormal P-wave indices, left axis deviation and early repolarization pattern were not associated with CHD or CVD.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: ECG abnormalities are highly prevalent in hypertensive individuals. LVH is still the cornerstone of cardiovascular risk assessment in hypertensive patients.

Emerging evidence supports the concept that immune cells become activated and enter target organs, including the vasculature and the kidney, in this disease. Mediators released by these cells, including reactive oxygen species, metalloproteinases, cytokines, and antibodies promote dysfunction of the target organs and cause damage. In vessels, these factors enhance constriction, remodeling, and rarefaction. In the kidney, these mediators increase expression and activation of sodium transporters, and cause interstitial fibrosis and glomerular injury. Factors common to hypertension, including oxidative stress, increased interstitial sodium, cytokine production, and inflammasome activation promote immune activation in hypertension. Recent data suggest that isolevuglandin-modified self-proteins in antigen-presenting cells are immunogenic, promoting cytokine production by the cells in which they are formed and T cell activation. Efforts to prevent and reverse immune activation may prove beneficial in preventing the long-term sequelae of hypertension and its related cardiovascular diseases.},

Accordingly, we review and update evidence for regulation of RAS components by pro-inflammatory factors. RECENT FINDINGS Angiotensin II (Ang II), which is produced by RAS, induces vasoconstriction and consequent blood pressure elevation. In addition to this direct action, chronically elevated Ang II stimulates several pathophysiological mechanisms including generation of oxidative stress, stimulation of the nervous system, alterations in renal hemodynamics, and activation of the immune system. In particular, an activated immune system has been shown to contribute to the development of hypertension. Recent studies have demonstrated that immune cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate RAS components, further accelerating systemic and local Ang II formation. Specifically, regulation of angiotensinogen (AGT) production by pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver and kidney is proposed as a key mechanism underlying the progression of Ang II-dependent hypertension.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, evidence has accumulated to suggest that hypertension is, at least in part, an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder. Many links between immunity and hypertension have been established and provide a complex framework of mechanistic interactions contributing to the rise in BP. These include immune-mediated inflammatory processes affecting regulatory brain nuclei and interactions with other mediators of cardiovascular regulation such as the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathoexcitation differentially regulates T-cells based upon activation status of the immune cell as well as the resident organ. Exogenous and endogenous triggers activate signalling pathways in innate and adaptive immune cells resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of T-lymphocytes in the cardiovascular and renal regions, now considered major factors in the development of essential hypertension. The inflammatory cascade is sustained and exacerbated by the immune flow via the brain-bone marrow-spleen-gastrointestinal axis and thereby further aggravating immune-mediated pathways resulting in a vicious cycle of established hypertension and target organ damage. This review summarizes the evidence and recent advances in linking immune-mediated inflammation, sympathetic activation and their bidirectional interactions with the development of hypertension.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Intimate partner violence (IPV) screening remains controversial. Major medical organizations mandate screening, whereas the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) cautions that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. An effective IPV screening program must include a screening tool with sound psychometric properties. A systematic review was conducted to summarize IPV screening tools tested in healthcare settings, providing a discussion of existing psychometric data and an assessment of study quality. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION From the end of 2007 through 2008, three published literature databases were searched from their start through December 2007; this search was augmented with a bibliography search and expert consultation. Eligible studies included English-language publications describing the psychometric testing of an IPV screening tool in a healthcare setting. Study quality was judged using USPSTF criteria for diagnostic studies. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Of 210 potentially eligible studies, 33 met inclusion criteria. The most studied tools were the Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream (HITS, sensitivity 30\%-100\%, specificity 86\%-99\%); the Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST, sensitivity 47\%, specificity 96\%); the Partner Violence Screen (PVS, sensitivity 35\%-71\%, specificity 80\%-94\%); and the Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS, sensitivity 93\%-94\%, specificity 55\%-99\%). Internal reliability (HITS, WAST); test-retest reliability (AAS); concurrent validity (HITS, WAST); discriminant validity (WAST); and predictive validity (PVS) were also assessed. Overall study quality was fair to good. CONCLUSIONS No single IPV screening tool had well-established psychometric properties. Even the most common tools were evaluated in only a small number of studies. Sensitivities and specificities varied widely within and between screening tools. Further testing and validation are critically needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Our study objectives were to assess the validity and reliability of the Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST) in the general population within the family practice setting; to determine the comfort levels of family physicians administering the WAST, their perceptions of its ability to help them identify abused women, and their willingness to continue using it in practice; and to determine the self-reported comfort of patients being asked the WAST questions by their family physicians. METHODS We included a stratified random sample of 20 physicians practicing in both urban and rural settings drawn from 400 family physicians in London, Ontario, Canada, and the surrounding area. These physicians administered the WAST to 10 to 15 eligible and consenting patients during the course of regular care. Following the physician-patient encounter, patients were asked to complete both a measure about their comfort in being asked each of the WAST questions and the Abuse Risk Inventory (ARI). RESULTS Scores on the WAST correlated well with those on the ARI. The reliability of the WAST among this sample was demonstrated by a coefficient alpha of 0.75. With the WAST-Short (the first 2 questions of the WAST), 26 of the 307 patients screened (8.5\%) were identified as experiencing abuse. The physicians were comfortable administering the WAST to their women patients, and 91\% of the patients reported being comfortable or very comfortable when asked the WAST questions by their family physician. CONCLUSIONS The WAST was found to be a reliable and valid measure of abuse in the family practice setting, with both patients and family physicians reporting comfort with it being part of the clinical encounter.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To systematically assess the evidence for an association between sexual abuse and a lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive search (from January 1980-December 2008, all age groups, any language, any population) of 9 databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, PsycINFO, ACP Journal Club, CCTR, CDSR, and DARE. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to define the concept areas of sexual abuse and psychiatric disorders and was limited to epidemiological studies. Six independent reviewers extracted descriptive, quality, and outcome data from eligible longitudinal studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled across studies by using the random-effects model. The I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS The search yielded 37 eligible studies, 17 case-control and 20 cohort, with 3,162,318 participants. There was a statistically significant association between sexual abuse and a lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorder (OR, 3.09; 95\% CI, 2.43-3.94), depression (OR, 2.66; 95\% CI, 2.14-3.30), eating disorders (OR, 2.72; 95\% CI, 2.04-3.63), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 2.34; 95\% CI, 1.59-3.43), sleep disorders (OR, 16.17; 95\% CI, 2.06-126.76), and suicide attempts (OR, 4.14; 95\% CI, 2.98-5.76). Associations persisted regardless of the victim's sex or the age at which abuse occurred. There was no statistically significant association between sexual abuse and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or somatoform disorders. No longitudinal studies that assessed bipolar disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder were found. Associations between sexual abuse and depression, eating disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder were strengthened by a history of rape. CONCLUSION A history of sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of a lifetime diagnosis of multiple psychiatric disorders.},

Its effects reverberate through families, communities, and nations and across generations. It is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults in most parts of the world. Exposure to interpersonal violence increases individuals’ lifelong vulnerability to a broad range of emotional, behavioral, and physical health problems. Interpersonal violence directly affects health care expenditures worldwide; indirectly, it affects national and local economies—stunting development, increasing inequality, and eroding human capital (WHO 2008). Attention to interpersonal violence as a global issue has expanded dramatically since the World Health Assembly identified violence as a public health priority in 1996. Reports by the United Nations (UN) have contributed greatly to increased awareness (Krug and others 2002; Pinheiro 2006; UN 2006). These and other efforts culminated in specific targets for eliminating interpersonal violence in the UN’s post-2015 Action Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN 2015).},

There is some limited recent evidence for how health settings can address domestic and sexual violence for female victims and their children. Recent studies of mixed quality focus on advocacy and empowerment, integrated interventions (with alcohol and drug misuse) and couples counselling for domestic violence and cognitive behavioural or processing therapy for sexual violence. Further research on perpetrator interventions in primary care is urgent. Larger sample sizes and a focus on sexual violence are needed to develop the evidence base for female survivors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Primary care providers have an important role in identifying survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) and providing safety options. Routine screening rates by providers have been consistently low, indicating a need to better understand providers' practices to ensure the translation of policy into clinical practice. AIM This systematic review examines common themes regarding provider screening practices and influencing factors on these practices. METHOD A literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search focused on research articles which met the following criteria: (1) health-care providers as participants, (2) provider reports on screening and counseling practices for IPV, and (3) were in English or Spanish. RESULTS A total of 35 studies were included in the review. Across studies, providers commonly acknowledged the importance of IPV screening yet often used only selective screening. Influencing factors on clinic, provider, and patient levels shaped the process and outcomes of provider screening practices. Overall, a great deal of variability exists in regard to provider screening practices. This variability may be due to a lack of clear system-level guidance for these practices and a lack of research regarding best practices. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest the necessity of more facilitative, clearly defined, and perhaps mandatory strategies to fulfill policy requirements. Future research directions are outlined to assist with these goals.},

Forty normotensives and 194 patients with hypertension were recruited for participation in this study. All patients accepted systemic combination drug treatment for antihypertension. According to the treatment results and the definition of refractory hypertension, the patients were divided into two groups: a refractory hypertension group and a non-refractory hypertension group. The epitope of the 2nd extracellular loop of type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptor and α1-adrenergic receptor were synthesized and used as antigens to screen the autoantibodies against AT1-receptor and α1-adrenergic receptor by ELISA. The plasma renin activity and concentration of angiotensin II and catecholamine were also examined. The positive rates of the autoantibodies against AT1-receptor and α1-adrenergic receptor in patients with hypertension, 26.8\% (52/194) and 25.3\% (49/194), respectively, were higher than those in normotensives (7.5\% and 5\%)(p{\textless}0.01). Further investigation showed that the frequencies of the autoantibodies against AT1-receptor and α1-adrenergic receptor in patients with refractory hypertension, 42.9\% (42/98) and 36.7\% (36/98), respectively, were higher than those in patients with non-refractory hypertension under systematic treatment (10.4\% and 13.5\%) (p{\textless}0.01). The levels of circulating angiotensin II, catecholamine, proteinuria and serum creatine were also higher in the refractory hypertension group than in the non-refractory hypertension group. The findings showed that the frequencies of autoantibodies against AT1-receptor and α1-adrenergic receptor were higher in patients with hypertension, particularly in those with refractory hypertension, and that these autoantibodies might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.},

	abstract = {The role of dendritic cells (DC) that accumulate in the renal parenchyma of non-immune-mediated proteinuric nephropathies is not well understood. Under certain circumstances, DC capture immunologically ignored antigens, including self-antigens, and present them within MHC class I, initiating an autoimmune response. We studied whether DC could generate antigenic peptides from the self-protein albumin. Exposure of rat proximal tubular cells to autologous albumin resulted in its proteolytic cleavage to form an N-terminal 24-amino acid peptide (ALB1-24). This peptide was further processed by the DC proteasome into antigenic peptides that had binding motifs for MHC class I and were capable of activating syngeneic CD8+ T cells. In vivo, the rat five-sixths nephrectomy model allowed the localization and activation of renal DC. Accumulation of DC in the renal parenchyma peaked 1 wk after surgery and decreased at 4 wk, concomitant with their appearance in the renal draining lymph nodes. DC from renal lymph nodes, loaded with ALB1-24, activated syngeneic CD8+ T cells in primary culture. The response of CD8 + T cells of five-sixths nephrectomized rats was amplified with secondary stimulation. In contrast, DC from renal lymph nodes of five-sixths nephrectomized rats treated with the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib lost their capacity to stimulate CD8+ T cells in primary and secondary cultures. These data suggest that albumin can be a source of potentially antigenic peptides upon renal injury and that renal DC play a role in processing self-proteins through a proteasome-dependent pathway.

	abstract = {Hypertension affects one-third of the adult population of the world. The causes of hypertension are incompletely understood, but relative impairment of sodium excretion is central to its pathogenesis. Immune cell infiltration in the kidney is a constant finding in hypertension that in association with local angiotensin and oxidants causes a defect in sodium excretion. However, it is unclear if the T cell influx into the kidney responds to nonspecific chemokine cues or is due to antigen-driven immune attraction. We found that T cells in experimentally induced salt-driven hypertension present a CD4 clonal response to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) that is over expressed in the kidney. We used a highly preserved amino acid sequence within the HSP molecule to induce immune tolerance associated with the generation of IL-10 producing regulatory T cells. Immune tolerant rats to HSP70 developed minimal renal inflammation and were protected from the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes isolated from spleen of tolerized rats also reversed hypertension. HSP70 gene delivery to the renal vein of the kidneys of rats sensitized to HSP70 caused an increment in blood pressure in response to a high-salt diet. The HSP70 peptide used in this work induces a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with essential hypertension. These studies provide evidence that autoimmunity plays a role in salt-sensitive hypertension and identifies HSP70 expressed in the kidney as one key antigen. These findings raise the possibility of novel approaches to the treatment of this condition. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

Accurate quantitation of the extent of protein modification by IsoLGs is essential for understanding the mechanisms whereby these modifications contribute to disease and the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent this modification. The previously described LC/MS assay to quantitate IsoLG protein adducts was extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, and while it offered reasonably low intra-day variation for replicate samples, variation when replicate samples were processed on separate days was significant. These limitations significantly restricted utilization of this approach. We therefore performed a series of studies to optimize the assay. We now report a significantly simplified LC/MS assay for measurement of IsoLG protein adducts with increased sensitivity and lower intra-day and inter-day variability.},

That LGE2- protein adducts can also be generated nonenzymatically is demonstrated by their production during free radical-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Like oxidized LDL, LGE2-LDL, but not native LDL, undergoes receptor-mediated uptake and impaired processing by macrophage cells. Since radical-induced lipid oxidation produces isomers of prostaglandins, isoprostanes (isoPs), via endoperoxide intermediates, we postulated previously that a similar family of LG isomers, isoLGs, is cogenerated with isoPs. Now iso[4]LGE2-protein epitopes produced by radical- induced oxidation of arachidonic acid in the presence of protein were detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Iso[4]LGE2-protein epitopes are also generated during free radical-induced oxidation of LDL. All of the LGE2 isomers generated upon oxidation of LDL are efficiently sequestered by covalent adduction with LDL-based amino groups. The potent electrophilic reactivity of iso-LGs can be anticipated to have biological consequences beyond their obvious potential as markers for specific arachidonate-derived protein modifications that may be of value for the quantitative assessment of oxidative injury.},

	abstract = {The immune system plays a prominent role in the initiation and maintenance of hypertension. The innate immune system, via toll-like receptors (TLRs), identifies distinct signatures of invading microbes and damage-associated molecular patterns and triggers a chain of downstream signalling cascades, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and shaping the adaptive immune response. Over the past decade, a dysfunctional TLR-mediated response, particularly via TLR4, has been suggested to support a chronic inflammatory state in hypertension, inducing deleterious local and systemic effects in host cells and tissues and contributing to disease progression. While the underlying mechanisms triggering TLR4 need further research, evidence suggests that sustained elevations in BP disrupt homeostasis, releasing endogenous TLR4 ligands in hypertension. In this review, we discuss the emerging role of TLR4 in the pathogenesis of hypertension and whether targeting this receptor and its signalling pathways could offer a therapeutic strategy for management of this multifaceted disease.

	abstract = {Oxidative damage and infammation are both implicated in the genesis of hypertension; however, the mechanisms by which these stimuli promote hypertension are not fully understood. Here, we have described a pathway in which hypertensive stimuli promote dendritic cell (DC) activation of T cells, ultimately leading to hypertension. Using multiple murine models of hypertension, we determined that proteins oxidatively modified by highly reactive γ-ketoaldehydes (isoketals) are formed in hypertension and accumulate in DCs. Isoketal accumulation was associated with DC production of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23 and an increase in costimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86. These activated DCs promoted T cell, particularly CD82+ T cell, proliferation; production of IFN-γ and IL-17A; and hypertension. Moreover, isoketal scavengers prevented these hypertension-associated events. Plasma F2-isoprostanes, which are formed in concert with isoketals, were found to be elevated in humans with treated hypertension and were markedly elevated in patients with resistant hypertension. Isoketal-modified proteins were also markedly elevated in circulating monocytes and DCs from humans with hypertension. Our data reveal that hypertension activates DCs, in large part by promoting the formation of isoketals, and suggest that reducing isoketals has potential as a treatment strategy for this disease.},

To derive a more precise estimation, we conducted a meta-analysis of all similar articles. Methods: The summary effect odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were obtained. Funnel plots and Egger’s test were used to estimate publication bias, and heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-square-based Q-test and I2 test. Results: Nine studies (with 1437 cases and 1487 controls) were included. In the overall analysis, the combined results showed that there were significant differences in genotype distribution between essential hypertension cases and controls, AA+GA versus GG (OR = 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.25–1.88, p {\textless} 0.00001). In the stratified analysis by country, we found that essential hypertension cases had a significantly higher frequency of AA+GA versus GG (OR = 1.47, 95\% CI: 1.18–1.81, p = 0.0004) than control in the Asian population. Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports previous findings that TNF-a -308G/A polymorphism may increase the risk of essential hypertension, at least in the Asian population.},

Family violence during pandemics is associated with a range of factors including economic stress, disaster-related instability, increased exposure to exploitative relationships, and reduced options for support (Peterman et al. 2020). Due to the social isolation measures implemented across the globe to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, people living in volatile situations of family violence are restricted to their homes. Social isolation exacerbates personal and collective vulnerabilities while limiting accessible and familiar support options (van Gelder et al. 2020). In many countries, including Australia, we have already seen an increase in demand for domestic violence services and reports of increased risk for children not attending schools (Duncan, 2020); a pattern similar to previous episodes of social isolation associated with epidemics and pandemics (Boddy, Young \& O'Leary 2020).},

We used four published formulae to convert spot urine sodium into estimates of 24-h sodium excretion in order to establish which (if any) formula would be suitable for use in the New Zealand population. A convenience sample of 101 healthy volunteers provided two spot urine samples and a 24-h urine collection. Two formulae (one proposed by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and one derived from INTERSALT data) were most accurate, and provided estimates of key population indicators (mean, range and proportion above nutrient reference values) that were close to those of the measured 24-h urine excretion. Estimates using these formula were in closer agreement with 24-h excretion than the other formulae estimates using the Bland-Altman method. We conclude that spot urine sampling is a suitable alternative to 24-h urine collection in population surveys when spot urine sodium results are converted into estimates of 24-h sodium excretion using either the PAHO or INTERSALT formulae. However spot urine is a poor predictor of 24-h urinary sodium excretion for individual assessment.},

	abstract = {Previous studies with some limitations have provided equivocal results for the prognostic significance of home-measured blood pressure (BP). We investigated whether home-measured BP is more strongly associated with cardiovascular events and total mortality than is office BP. A prospective nationwide study was initiated in 2000 to 2001 on 2081 randomly selected subjects aged 45 to 74 years. Home and office BP were determined at baseline along with other cardiovascular risk factors. The primary end point was incidence of a cardiovascular event (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). The secondary end point was total mortality. After a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, 162 subjects had experienced a cardiovascular event, and 118 subjects had died. In Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors, office BP (systolic/diastolic hazard ratio [HR] per 10/5 mm Hg increase in BP, 1.13/1.13; systolic/diastolic 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.22/1.05 to 1.22) and home BP (HR, 1.23/1.18; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 1.34/1.10 to 1.27) were predictive of cardiovascular events. However, when both BPs were simultaneously included in the models, only home BP (HR, 1.22/1.15; 95\% CI, 1.09 to 1.37/1.05 to 1.26), not office BP (HR, 1.01/1.06; 95\% CI, 0.92 to 1.12/0.97 to 1.16), was predictive of cardiovascular events. Systolic home BP was the sole predictor of total mortality (HR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01/1.23). Our findings suggest that home-measured BP is prognostically superior to office BP. On the basis of the results of this and previous studies, it can be concluded that home BP measurement offers specific advantages more than conventional office measurement. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Methods and results: We have compared daily sodium (Na) excretion from PABA validated 24-hurine collections with estimated daily sodium excretion derived from the following methods: a standard Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a modified 24-hdietary recall method, arithmetic extrapolations from morning and evening spot urine samples, predicted sodium excretion from morning and evening spot urine samples using Tanaka's, Kawasaki's and the INTERSALT formula. All were assessed using mean differences (SD), Bland-Altman plots, correlation coefficients and ROC Area under the Curve (AUC) for a cut off of ≥100mmol of Na/day. The Food Choice at Work study recruited 802 participants aged 18-64 years, 50 of whom formed the validation sample. The mean measured 24-hurinary sodium (gold standard) was 138mmol/day (8.1g salt). At the group level, mean differences were small for both dietary methods and for the arithmetic extrapolations from morning urine samples. The Tanaka, Kawasaki and INTERSALT methods provided biased estimates of 24-hurinary sodium. R2 values for all methods ranged from 0.1 to 0.48 and AUC findings from 0.57 to 0.76. Conclusion: Neither dietary nor spot urine sample methods provide adequate validity in the estimation of 24-hurinary sodium at the individual level. However, group mean errors from dietary methods are small and random and compare favourably with those from spot urine samples in this population.},

	abstract = {Fierce debate has developed whether low-sodium intake, like high-sodium intake, could be associated with adverse outcome. The debate originates in earlier epidemiological studies associating high-sodium intake with high blood pressure and more recent studies demonstrating a higher cardiovascular event rate with both low- and high-sodium intake. This brings into question whether we entirely understand the consequences of high- and (very) low-sodium intake for the systemic hemodynamics, the kidney function, the vascular wall, the immune system, and the brain. Evolutionarily, sodium retention mechanisms in the context of low dietary sodium provided a survival advantage and are highly conserved, exemplified by the renin-angiotensin system. What is the potential for this sodium-retaining mechanism to cause harm? In this paper, we will consider current views on how a sodium load is handled, visiting aspects including the effect of sodium on the vessel wall, the sympathetic nervous system, the brain renin-angiotensin system, the skin as “third compartment” coupling to vascular endothelial growth factor C, and the kidneys. From these perspectives, several mechanisms can be envisioned whereby a low-sodium diet could potentially cause harm, including the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. Altogether, the uncertainties preclude a unifying model or practical clinical guidance regarding the effects of a low-sodium diet for an individual. There is a very strong need for fundamental and translational studies to enhance the understanding of the potential adverse consequences of low-salt intake as an initial step to facilitate better clinical guidance.},

Methods: We analysed spot urine results, 24-h diet recall, dietary habits questionnaire and anthropometry from a representative sample of 3312 adults aged 15 years and older who participated in the 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey. Estimates of adult population sodium intake were derived from 24-h diet recall and spot urine sodium using a formula derived from analysis of INTERSALT data. Correlations, limits of agreement and mean difference were calculated for the total sample, and for population subgroups. Results: Estimated total population 24-h urinary sodium excretion (mean (95\% CI)) from spot urine samples was 3035 mg (2990, 3079); 3612 mg (3549, 3674) for men and 2507 mg (2466, 2548) for women. Estimated mean usual daily sodium intake from 24-h diet recall data (excluding salt added at the table) was 2564 mg (2519, 2608); 2849 mg (2779, 2920) for men and 2304 mg (2258, 2350) for women. Correlations between estimates were poor, especially for men, and limits of agreement using Bland–Altman mean difference analysis were wide. Conclusions: There is a poor agreement between estimates of individual sodium intake from spot urine collection and those from 24-hour diet recall. Although, both 24-hour dietary recall and estimated urinary excretion based on spot urine indicate mean population sodium intake is greater than 2 g, significant differences in mean intake by method deserve further investigation in relation to the gold standard, 24-hour urinary sodium excretion.},

Two paper SFFQs, 1 Web-based SFFQ, 4 ASA24s (beta version), 2 7DDRs, 4 24-hour urine samples, 1 doubly labeled water measurement (repeated among 76 participants), and 2 fasting blood samples were collected over a 15-month period. The dietary variables evaluated were energy, energy-Adjusted intakes of protein, sodium, potassium, and specific fatty acids, carotenoids, α-Tocopherol, retinol, and folate. In general, relative to biomarkers, averaged ASA24s had lower validity than the SFFQ completed at the end of the data-collection year (SFFQ2); SFFQ2 had slightly lower validity than 1 7DDR; the averaged SFFQs had validity similar to that of 1 7DDR; and the averaged 7DDRs had the highest validity. The deattenuated correlation of energy-Adjusted protein intake assessed by SFFQ2 with its biomarker was 0.46, similar to its correlation with 7DDRs (deattenuated r = 0.54). These data indicate that the SFFQ2 provides reasonably valid measurements of energy-Adjusted intake for most of the nutrients assessed in our study, consistent with earlier conclusions derived using 7DDRs as the comparison method. The ASA24 needs further evaluation for use in large population studies, but an average of 3 days of measurement will not be sufficient for some important nutrients.},

With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk- outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To estimate global, regional (21 regions) and national (187 countries) sodium intakes in adults in 1990 and 2010. Design: Bayesian hierarchical modelling using all identifiable primary sources. Data sources and eligibility: We searched and obtained published and unpublished data from 142 surveys of 24 h urinary sodium and 103 of dietary sodium conducted between 1980 and 2010 across 66 countries. Dietary estimates were converted to urine equivalents based on 79 pairs of dual measurements. Modelling methods: Bayesian hierarchical modelling used survey data and their characteristics to estimate mean sodium intake, by sex, 5 years age group and associated uncertainty for persons aged 20+ in 187 countries in 1990 and 2010. Country-level covariates were national income/person and composition of food supplies. Main outcome measures: Mean sodium intake (g/day) as estimable by 24 h urine collections, without adjustment for non-urinary losses. Results: In 2010, global mean sodium intake was 3.95 g/day (95\% uncertainty interval: 3.89 to 4.01). This was nearly twice the WHO recommended limit of 2 g/day and equivalent to 10.06 (9.88-10.21) g/day of salt. Intake in men was ∼10\% higher than in women; differences by age were small. Intakes were highest in East Asia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe (mean {\textgreater}4.2 g/day) and in Central Europe and Middle East/ North Africa (3.9-4.2 g/day). Regional mean intakes in North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand ranged from 3.4 to 3.8 g/day. Intakes were lower ({\textless}3.3 g/day), but more uncertain, in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Between 1990 and 2010, modest, but uncertain, increases in sodium intakes were identified. Conclusions: Sodium intakes exceed the recommended levels in almost all countries with small differences by age and sex. Virtually all populations would benefit from sodium reduction, supported by enhanced surveillance.},

This review compares estimates of mean population salt intake based upon spot and 24-h urine samples. Methods: We systematically searched for all studies that reported estimates of daily salt intake based upon both spot and 24-h urine samples for the same population. The associations between the two were quantified and compared overall and in subsets of studies. Results: A total of 538 records were identified, 108 were assessed as full text and 29 were included. The included studies involved 10 414 participants from 34 countries and made 71 comparisons available for the primary analysis. Overall average population salt intake estimated from 24-h urine samples was 9.3 g/day compared with 9.0 g/day estimated from the spot urine samples. Estimates based upon spot urine samples had excellent sensitivity (97\%) and specificity (100\%) at classifying mean population salt intake as above or below the World Health Organization maximum target of 5 g/day. Compared with the 24-h samples, estimates based upon spot urine overestimated intake at lower levels of consumption and underestimated intake at higher levels of consumption. Conclusions: Estimates of mean population salt intake based upon spot urine samples can provide countries with a good indication of mean population salt intake and whether action on salt consumption is required.},

We present the biologic rationale and scientific evidence that show that the current salt intake levels largely explain the high prevalence of hypertension. Comprehensive reduction of salt intake, both alone and particularly in combination with increases in intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, is able to lower average blood pressure levels substantially. During the past 30 years, the one-third decrease in the average salt intake has been accompanied by a more than 10-mm Hg fall in the population average of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and a 75\% to 80\% decrease in both stroke and coronary heart disease mortality in Finland. There is no evidence of any harmful effects of salt reduction. Salt-reduction recommendations alone have a very small, if any, population impact. In the United States, for example, the per capita use of salt increased by approximately 55\% from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. We deal with factors that contribute toward increasing salt intakes and present examples of the methods that have contributed to the successful salt reduction in Finland. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Questionnaires are commonly used to collect patient, or user, experiences with health care encounters; however, their adaption to specific target groups limits comparison between groups. We present the construction of a generic questionnaire (maximum of ten questions) for user evaluation across a range of health care services. Methods. Based on previous testing of six group-specific questionnaires, we first constructed a generic questionnaire with 23 items related to user experiences. All questions included a "not applicable" response option, as well as a follow-up question about the item's importance. Nine user groups from one health trust were surveyed. Seven groups received questionnaires by mail and two by personal distribution. Selection of core questions was based on three criteria: applicability (proportion "not applicable"), importance (mean scores on follow-up questions), and comprehensiveness (content coverage, maximum two items per dimension). Results: 1324 questionnaires were returned providing subsample sizes ranging from 52 to 323. Ten questions were excluded because the proportion of "not applicable" responses exceeded 20\% in at least one user group. The number of remaining items was reduced to ten by applying the two other criteria. The final short questionnaire included items on outcome (2), clinician services (2), user involvement (2), incorrect treatment (1), information (1), organisation (1), and accessibility (1). Conclusion: The Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire (GS-PEQ) is a short, generic set of questions on user experiences with specialist health care that covers important topics for a range of groups. It can be used alone or with other instruments in quality assessment or in research. The psychometric properties and the relevance of the GS-PEQ in other health care settings and countries need further evaluation. © 2011 Sjetne et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the rate of IPV disclosure in adult women ({\textgreater}18 years of age) with the use of three different screening tool administration methods: computer-assisted self-administered screen, self-administered written screen, and face-to-face interview screen. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and the Cochrane library databases. We identified 746 potentially relevant articles; however, only 6 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and included for analysis. No significant differences were observed when women were screened in face-to-face interviews or with a self-administered written screen (Odds of disclosing: 1.02, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: [0.77, 1.35]); however, a computer-assisted self-administered screen was found to increase the odds of IPV disclosure by 37\% in comparison to a face-to-face interview screen (odds ratio: 0.63, 95\% CI: [0.31, 1.30]). Disclosure of IPV was also 23\% higher for computer-assisted self-administered screen in comparison to self-administered written screen (Odds of disclosure: 1.23, 95\% CI: [0.0.92, 1.64]). The results of this review suggest that computer-assisted self-administered screens leads to higher rates of IPV disclosure in comparison to both face-to-face interview and self-administered written screens.},

Specifically, the present study sought to clarify how Twitter users utilized the \#MeToo tag to disclose and respond to sexual violence by conducting a qualitative analysis of a random sample of tweets using \#MeToo ( N = 1,660). Survivors frequently prioritized the "who," "what," "where," "when," "why," and "how" of personal trauma experiences when disclosing using \#MeToo. Twitter users also reflected on the prevalence of violence in society, acted as advocates to highlight the problem of violence against women, called attention to the experiences of other survivors of violence, or utilized the forum in a manner that distracted from survivors' experiences. The present data highlight the utility of Twitter for raising awareness regarding the prevalence of sexual violence, and providing a space where users can share personal trauma, connect to others with similar experiences, and provide support to others.},

This review aims to summarize recent advances in the field, illustrate the connections between the gut and hypertension, and establish that the gut microbiota (GM)-gut interaction is centrally positioned for consideration as an innovative approach for HTN therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS Animal models of HTN have shown that gut pathology occurs in HTN, and provides some clues to mechanisms linking the dysbiosis, gut pathology, and HTN. Circumstantial evidence links gut dysbiosis and HTN. Gut pathology, apparent in animal HTN models, has not been fully investigated in hypertensive patients.

	abstract = {High blood pressure (BP) is a complex and multifactorial condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies in {\textgreater}300,000 individuals have identified several single genetic variants linked to BP control and hypertension, but these variants only explained a very small proportion ({\textless}5\%) of the interindividual variation in systolic BP 1-3. Lifestyle and environmental factors are well-established contributors to increased BP 4. These factors include, among others, physical inactivity, obesity, high alcohol consumption, tobacco use, high stress levels, and poor diet (including high intake of fat, sugar, and salt) 4,5. Over the past decade, increasing evidence has linked the activity and composition of the gut microbiota with human health and disease. Specifically, the composition of the gut microbiota is likely to affect many organ systems, including the cardiovascular, immune, neural, and metabolic systems. The composition of gut microbiota is altered in many disease states, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) 6 , colitis 7 , malignancy 8 , type 2 diabetes mellitus 9 , obesity 10 , psychiatric disorders 11,12 , asthma 13 , and numerous immune disorders 14,15. The pathogenesis of most of these diseases are closely influenced by lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise 14. These observations provide a new perspective on human disease, and suggest that the gut microbiota and its metabolites might be as important as genetic factors for determining (or preventing) a whole host of human diseases. The importance of the gut microbiota is further underscored by epidemio logical studies that have drawn associations between differences in disease rates with variations in the composition of the gut microbiota 16. Many diseases, including CVD, seem to fit a model whereby adverse environ mental factors, such as insufficient intake of dietary fibre, excessive consumption of food preservatives, and inappropriate use or overuse of antibiotics can alter the composition of the gut micro biota. This proposed disease model also suggests that major improvements in health might be achiev able through new approaches to alter the composition of the gut microbiota, for example, by the use of prebiotics (benefi cial foodstuffs) or probiotics (benefi-cial bacteria for gut health).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently, the potential role of gut microbiome in metabolic diseases has been revealed, especially in cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide, yet whether gut microbiota dysbiosis participates in the development of hypertension remains largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we carried out comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses in a cohort of 41 healthy controls, 56 subjects with pre-hypertension, 99 individuals with primary hypertension, and performed fecal microbiota transplantation from patients to germ-free mice. RESULTS Compared to the healthy controls, we found dramatically decreased microbial richness and diversity, Prevotella-dominated gut enterotype, distinct metagenomic composition with reduced bacteria associated with healthy status and overgrowth of bacteria such as Prevotella and Klebsiella, and disease-linked microbial function in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive populations. Unexpectedly, the microbiome characteristic in pre-hypertension group was quite similar to that in hypertension. The metabolism changes of host with pre-hypertension or hypertension were identified to be closely linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis. And a disease classifier based on microbiota and metabolites was constructed to discriminate pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals from controls accurately. Furthermore, by fecal transplantation from hypertensive human donors to germ-free mice, elevated blood pressure was observed to be transferrable through microbiota, and the direct influence of gut microbiota on blood pressure of the host was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our results describe a novel causal role of aberrant gut microbiota in contributing to the pathogenesis of hypertension. And the significance of early intervention for pre-hypertension was emphasized.},

	abstract = {The combination of obesity and hypertension is associated with high morbidity and mortality because it leads to cardiovascular and kidney disease. Potential mechanisms linking obesity to hypertension include dietary factors, metabolic, endothelial and vascular dysfunction, neuroendocrine imbalances, sodium retention, glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, and maladaptive immune and inflammatory responses. Visceral adipose tissue also becomes resistant to insulin and leptin and is the site of altered secretion of molecules and hormones such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin, TNF and IL-6, which exacerbate obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. Accumulating evidence also suggests that the gut microbiome is important for modulating these mechanisms. Uric acid and altered incretin or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity further contribute to the development of hypertension in obesity. The pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension is especially relevant to premenopausal women with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus who are at high risk of developing arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

Total SCFA concentration (mmol/kg) was low in the terminal ileum at 13±6 but high in all regions of the colon ranging from 131±9 in the caecum to 80± 11 in the descending colon. The presence of branched chain fatty acids was also noted. A significant trend from high to low concentrations was found on passing distally from caecum to descending colon. pH also changed with region from 5.6±0.2 in the caecum to 6.6±0.1 in the descending colon. pH and SCFA concentrations were inversely related. Total SCFA (μmol/l) in blood was, portal 375±70, hepatic 148±42 and peripheral 79±22. In all samples acetate was the principal anion but molar ratios of the three principal SCFA changed on going from colonic contents to portal blood to hepatic vein indicating greater uptake of butyrate by the colonic epithelium and propionate by the liver. These data indicate that substantial carbohydrate, and possibly protein, fermentation is occurring in the human large intestine, principally in the caecum and ascending colon and that the large bowel may have a greater role to play in digestion than has previously been ascribed to it.},

Microbiota metabolize resistant starches and dietary fibers through fermentation and decomposition, and provide short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to the host. The major SCFAs acetates, propionate and butyrate, have different production ratios and physiological activities. Several receptors for SCFAs have been identified as the G-protein coupled receptor 41/free fatty acid receptor 3 (GPR41/FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, and olfactory receptor 78, which are present in intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, and adipocytes, despite their expression levels differing between tissues and cell types. Many studies have indicated that SCFAs exhibit a wide range of functions from immune regulation to metabolism in a variety of tissues and organs, and therefore have both a direct and indirect influence on our bodies. This review will focus on SCFAs, especially butyrate, and their effects on various inflammatory mechanisms including atherosclerosis. In the future, SCFAs may provide new insights into understanding the pathophysiology of chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and atherosclerosis, and we can expect the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Background. In humans, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of host health by providing energy, nutrients, and immunological protection. Applying current molecular methods is necessary to surmount the limitations of classical culturing techniques in order to obtain an accurate description of the microbiota composition. Results. Here we report on the comparative assessment of human fecal microbiota from three age-groups: infants, adults and the elderly. We demonstrate that the human intestinal microbiota undergoes maturation from birth to adulthood and is further altered with ageing. The counts of major bacterial groups Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). By comparing species diversity profiles, we observed age-related changes in the human fecal microbiota. The microbiota of infants was generally characterized by low levels of total bacteria. C. leptum and C. coccoides species were highly represented in the microbiota of infants, while elderly subjects exhibited high levels of E. coli and Bacteroidetes. We observed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes evolves during different life stages. For infants, adults and elderly individuals we measured ratios of 0.4, 10.9 and 0.6, respectively. Conclusion. In this work we have confirmed that qPCR is a powerful technique in studying the diverse and complex fecal microbiota. Our work demonstrates that the fecal microbiota composition evolves throughout life, from early childhood to old age. © 2009 Mariat et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background Recent evidence suggests that insufficient oxidative capacity or mitochondrial dysfunction may play a causal role in the development of high blood pressure. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in the general population. We hypothesized that lactate, a measure of oxidative capacity, would be positively associated with incident hypertension even after accounting for traditional hypertension risk factors. Methods Plasma lactate was measured in 5,554 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study with no subclinical or diagnosed hypertension at baseline (1996-1998). Incident hypertension was defined by self-report or hypertension medication use. Analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards models. Results The mean age was 61.9 years, and the mean lactate was 0.8 mmol/L. During a median follow-up period of 11.9 years (range = 26.9 days to 13.4 years), there were 3,849 new cases of hypertension. The fourth quartile of lactate (compared with the first quartile) was associated with an elevated risk of hypertension (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.31) even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, including baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This association was stronger when the population was restricted to participants with normal blood pressure ({\textless}120mm Hg/{\textless}80mm Hg; HR = 1.42; 95\% CI = 1.23-1.63). In strata of sex, the association was strong in women vs. null in men (P interaction = 0.01). Conclusions Plasma lactate is associated with incident hypertension in women, especially with a normal blood pressure ({\textless}120mm Hg/{\textless}80mm Hg). Future studies should elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations.},

	abstract = {The important role of the gut microbiome in maintaining human health has necessitated a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of intestinal microbial communities as well as the host and environmental factors driving these dynamics. Genetics, mode of birth, infant feeding patterns, antibiotic usage, sanitary living conditions and long term dietary habits contribute to shaping the composition of the gut microbiome. This review focuses primarily on diet, as it is one of the most pivotal factors in the development of the human gut microbiome from infancy to the elderly. The infant gut microbiota is characterized by a high degree of instability, only reaching a state similar to that of adults by 2-3 years of age; consistent with the establishment of a varied solid food diet. The diet-related factors influencing the development of the infant gut microbiome include whether the child is breast or formula-fed as well as how and when solid foods are introduced. In contrast to the infant gut, the adult gut microbiome is resilient to large shifts in community structure. Several studies have shown that dietary changes induce transient fluctuations in the adult microbiome, sometimes in as little as 24 hours; however, the microbial community rapidly returns to its stable state. Current knowledge of how long-term dietary habits shape the gut microbiome is limited by the lack of long-term feeding studies coupled with temporal gut microbiota characterization. However, long-term weight loss studies have been shown to alter the ratio of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the two major bacterial phyla residing in the human gastrointestinal tract. With ageing, diet-related factors such as malnutrition are associated with microbiome shifts, although the cause and effect relationship between these factors has not been established. Increased pharmaceutical usage is also more prevalent in the elderly and can contribute to reduced gut microbiota stability and diversity. Foods containing prebiotic oligosaccharide components that nurture beneficial commensals in the gut community and probiotic supplements are being explored as interventions to manipulate the gut microbiome, potentially improving health status.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review The gut microbiota and its metabolites have been implicated in the regulation of host physiological functions such as inflammatory and metabolic responses. The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor is expressed in the kidney and blood vessels as well, and has been reported to function as a regulator of blood pressure (BP). This review highlights the role of SCFAs derived from gut microbial fermentation in the regulation of BP. Recent findings Olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, and it plays a key role as a chemosensor in various tissues. Both Olfr78 and G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) are expressed in smooth muscle cells of blood vessels and they recognize SCFAs. Oral administration of SCFAs was found to change BP in vivo, an effect that was altered in Olfr78 and GPR41-deficient mice. Summary The regulation of BP via SCFA receptors has provided new insights into the interactions between the gut microbiota and BP control systems. We summarize these interactions and describe their contributions to a novel pathway involved in BP regulation. These recent findings could open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Hypertension is associated with gut dysbiosis. Here we have evaluated the effects of the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan on gut microbiota in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to assess their contribution to its antihypertensive effects. Experimental Approach: Twenty-week-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR were treated with losartan for 5 weeks (SHR-losartan). Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed from donor SHR-losartan group to recipient untreated-SHR. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using tail-cuff plethysmography. Composition of the gut microbiota was assessed by amplification of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. T cells were analysed in gut/aorta by flow cytometry. Key Results: Faeces from SHR showed gut dysbiosis, characterised by higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios, lower acetate- and higher lactate-producing bacteria, and lower levels of strict anaerobic bacteria, effects which were restored to normal by losartan. Improvement of gut dysbiosis was linked to higher colonic integrity and lower sympathetic drive in the gut. In contrast, hydralazine reduced BP, but it neither restored gut dysbiosis nor colonic integrity. FMT from SHR-losartan to SHR reduced BP, improved the aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh, and reduced NADPH oxidase activity. These vascular changes were accompanied by both increased Treg and decreased Th17 cell populations in the vascular wall. Conclusion and Implications: In SHR, losartan treatment reduced gut dysbiosis and sympathetic drive in the gut, thus improving gut integrity. The changes induced by losartan in gut microbiota contributed, in part, to protecting the vasculature and reducing BP, possibly by modulating the immune system in the gut.},

	abstract = {Olfactory receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate olfactory chemosensation and serve as chemosensors in other tissues. We find that Olfr78, an olfactory receptor expressed in the kidney, responds to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Olfr78 is expressed in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, where it mediates renin secretion in response to SCFAs. In addition, both Olfr78 and G protein-coupled receptor 41 (Gpr41), another SCFA receptor, are expressed in smooth muscle cells of small resistance vessels. Propionate, a SCFA shown to induce vasodilation ex vivo, produces an acute hypotensive response in wild-type mice. This effect is differentially modulated by disruption of Olfr78 and Gpr41 expression. SCFAs are end products of fermentation by the gut microbiota and are absorbed into the circulation. Antibiotic treatment reduces the biomass of the gut microbiota and elevates blood pressure in Olfr78 knockout mice. We conclude that SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota modulate blood pressure via Olfr78 and Gpr41.},

	abstract = {Butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. Human colonic butyrate producers are Gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to Eubacterium rectale/Roseburia spp. and to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-CoA : acetate CoA-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. Mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut Clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. Here we suggest that these mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. The roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. Populations of F. prausnitzii are reported to be decreased in Crohn's disease, for example, while populations of Roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

	abstract = {Rationale: Microglial activation in autonomic brain regions is a hallmark of neuroinflammation in neurogenic hypertension. Despite evidence that an impaired sympathetic nerve activity supplying the bone marrow (BM) increases inflammatory cells and decreases angiogenic cells, little is known about the reciprocal impact of BM-derived inflammatory cells on neuroinflammation in hypertension. Objective: To test the hypothesis that proinflammatory BM cells from hypertensive animals contribute to neuroinflammation and hypertension via a brain-BM interaction. Methods and Results: After BM ablation in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and reconstitution with normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat BM, the resultant chimeric spontaneously hypertensive rats displayed significant reduction in mean arterial pressure associated with attenuation of both central and peripheral inflammation. In contrast, an elevated mean arterial pressure along with increased central and peripheral inflammation was observed in chimeric Wistar-Kyoto rats reconstituted with spontaneously hypertensive rat BM. Oral treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, attenuated hypertension in both the spontaneously hypertensive rats and the chronic angiotensin II-infused rats. This was accompanied by decreased sympathetic drive and inflammation. Furthermore, in chronic angiotensin II-infused rats, minocycline prevented extravasation of BM-derived cells to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, presumably via a mechanism of decreased C-C chemokine ligand 2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusions: The BM contributes to hypertension by increasing peripheral inflammatory cells and their extravasation into the brain. Minocycline is an effective therapy to modify neurogenic components of hypertension. These observations support the hypothesis that BM-derived cells are involved in neuroinflammation, and targeting them may be an innovative strategy for neurogenic resistant hypertension therapy.},

	abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), are caused by a complex interplay between genetic, immunologic, microbial and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.},

Results: Fiber supplementation (average dose, 11.5 g/d) changed systolic BP by -1.13 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval: -2.49 to 0.23) and diastolic BP by -1.26 mm Hg (-2.04 to -0.48).

Methods: A systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using random-effects models. Eligibility criteria for studies included randomized controlled trials of at least 6 weeks duration, testing a fibre isolate or fibre-rich diet against a control or placebo published between 1 January 1990 and 1 December 2013. Results: Twenty-eight trials met the inclusion criteria and reported fibre intake and SBP and/or DBP. Eighteen trials were included in a meta-analysis. Studies were categorized into 1 of 12 fibre-type categories. The pooled estimates for all fibre types were -0.9 mmHg [95\% confidence interval (CI) -2.5 to 0.6 mmHg] and -0.7 mmHg (95\% CI -1.9 to 0.5 mmHg) for SBP and DBP, respectively. The median difference in total fibre was 6 g. Analyses of specific fibre types concluded that diets rich in beta-glucans reduce SBP by 2.9 mmHg (95\% CI 0.9 to 4.9 mmHg) and DBP by 1.5 mmHg (95\% CI 0.2 to 2.7 mmHg) for a median difference in beta-glucans of 4 g. Heterogeneity for individual fibre types was generally low. Conclusions: Higher consumption of beta-glucan fibre is associated with lower SBP and DBP. The results of this review are consistent with recommendations to increase consumption of foods rich in dietary fibre, but some additional emphasis on sources of beta-glucans, such as oats and barley, may be warranted.},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world. By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Other short chain carboxylic acid anions such as formate, propionate, butyrate, and pentanoate also had agonist activity. GPR41 is related to GPR43 (52\% similarity; 43\% identity) and was activated by similar ligands but with differing specificity for carbon chain length, with pentanoate being the most potent agonist. A third family member, GPR42, is most likely a recent gene duplication of GPR41 and may be a pseudogene. GPR41 was expressed primarily in adipose tissue, whereas the highest levels of GPR43 were found in immune cells.

AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced functional T reg cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole interfered with T reg cell development, boosted T H 17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T reg and T H 17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation. Pathogenic autoimmunity is controlled in healthy individuals by a specialized subset of T cells named T reg cells 1. T reg cell differentiation and function are driven by the transcription factor Foxp3 (refs 2, 3). Mice carrying a mutant Foxp3 show impaired T reg cell activity and succumb to a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder, which can be prevented by the transgenic expression of wild-type Foxp3 (ref. 4). FOXP3 is also important for human T reg cells; mutations in FOXP3 have been linked to the autoimmune syndrome immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) 5,6. T reg cell development is closely related to the generation of inter-leukin (IL)-17-producing T cells (T H 17). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 induces the differentiation of T reg cells 7 , whereas TGF-b1 in combination with IL-6 (ref. 8) or IL-21 (ref. 9) results in the differentiation of T H 17 cells. T H 17 cells express the transcription factor ROR-ct 10 , participate in the control of extracellular pathogens and have an important role in human and experimental autoimmunity 11. Thus, the identification of the pathways that control T reg and T H 17 cell differentiation is of importance for the treatment of autoimmunity, infections and cancer.

The ecophysiology, including growth requirements and responses to environmental factors, of major propionate and butyrate producing bacteria are discussed in relation to dietary modulation of these metabolites.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Inflammasomes are multimeric complexes that facilitate caspase-1-mediated processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Clinical hypertension is associated with renal inflammation and elevated circulating levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Therefore, we investigated whether hypertension in mice is associated with increased expression and/or activation of the inflammasome in the kidney, and if inhibition of inflammasome activity reduces BP, markers of renal inflammation and fibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Wild-type and inflammasome-deficient ASC(-/-) mice were uninephrectomized and received deoxycorticosterone acetate and saline to drink (1K/DOCA/salt). Control mice were uninephrectomized but received a placebo pellet and water. BP was measured by tail cuff; renal expression of inflammasome subunits and inflammatory markers was measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting; macrophage and collagen accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry. KEY RESULTS 1K/DOCA/salt-induced hypertension in mice was associated with increased renal mRNA expression of inflammasome subunits NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1, and the cytokine, pro-IL-1β, as well as protein levels of active caspase-1 and mature IL-1β. Following treatment with 1K/DOCA/salt, ASC(-/-) mice displayed blunted pressor responses and were also protected from increases in renal expression of IL-6, IL-17A, CCL2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and accumulation of macrophages and collagen. Finally, treatment with a novel inflammasome inhibitor, MCC950, reversed hypertension in 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Renal inflammation, fibrosis and elevated BP induced by 1K/DOCA/salt treatment are dependent on inflammasome activity, highlighting the inflammasome/IL-1β pathway as a potential therapeutic target in hypertension.},

PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2) has been implicated in the inflammation associated with hypertension. We hypothesized that PGE2 via its EP (E prostanoid) 3 receptor contributes to DC activation in hypertension. EP3-/- mice and wild-type littermates were exposed to sequential hypertensive stimuli involving an initial 2-week exposure to the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride in drinking water, followed by a 2-week washout period, and a subsequent 4\% high-salt diet for 3 weeks. In wild-type mice, this protocol increased systolic pressure from 123±2 to 148±8 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.05). This was associated with marked renal inflammation and a striking accumulation of isoLG adducts in splenic DCs. However, the increases in blood pressure, renal T-cell infiltration, and DC isoLG formation were completely prevented in EP3-/- mice. Similar protective effects were also observed in wild-type mice that received intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector encoding shRNA targeting the EP3 receptor. Further, in vitro experiments indicated that PGE2 also acts directly on DCs via its EP1 receptors to stimulate intracellular isoLG formation. Together, these findings provide new insight into how EP receptors in both the central nervous system and peripherally on DCs promote inflammation in salt-induced hypertension.},

	abstract = {Excess dietary salt contributes to inflammation and hypertension via poorly understood mechanisms. Antigen-presenting cells including DCs play a key role in regulating intestinal immune homeostasis in part by surveying the gut epithelial surface for pathogens. Previously, we found that highly reactive γ-ketoaldehydes or isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) accumulate in DCs and act as neoantigens, promoting an autoimmune-like state and hypertension. We hypothesized that excess dietary salt alters the gut microbiome leading to hypertension and this is associated with increased immunogenic IsoLG adduct formation in myeloid antigen-presenting cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed fecal microbiome analysis and measured blood pressure of healthy human volunteers with salt intake above or below the American Heart Association recommendations. We also performed 16S rRNA analysis on cecal samples of mice fed normal or high-salt diets. In humans and mice, high-salt intake was associated with changes in the gut microbiome reflecting an increase in Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and genus Prevotella bacteria. These alterations were associated with higher blood pressure in humans and predisposed mice to vascular inflammation and hypertension in response to a subpressor dose of angiotensin II. Mice fed a high-salt diet exhibited increased intestinal inflammation, including the mesenteric arterial arcade and aorta, with a marked increase in the B7 ligand CD86 and formation of IsoLG protein adducts in CD11c+ myeloid cells. Adoptive transfer of fecal material from conventionally housed high-salt diet–fed mice to germ-free mice predisposed them to increased inflammation and hypertension. These findings provide potentially novel insights into the mechanisms underlying inflammation and hypertension associated with excess dietary salt and may lead to interventions targeting the microbiome to prevent and treat this important disease.},

The precise intracellular mechanisms by which these hypertensive stimuli lead to IsoLG-protein adduct formation are still not well understood; however, there is now evidence implicating NADPH-oxidase derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. ROS oxidize arachidonic acid leading to formation of IsoLGs, which non-covalently adduct to lysine residues and alter protein structure and function. Recent studies suggest that these altered proteins act as neo-antigens leading to an autoimmune state that results in hypertension. The goal of this mini-review is to highlight some of the hypertensive stimuli and the mechanisms contributing to IsoLG-protein adduct formation leading to inflammation and hypertension.},

Increasing dietary salt from 0.4\% to 4.0\% NaCl significantly increased renal infiltration of T lymphocytes from 8.8 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 14.4 +/- 2.0 x 10(5) cells/2 kidneys, increased arterial blood pressure from 131 +/- 2 to 165 +/- 6 mmHg, increased albumin excretion rate from 17 +/- 3 to 129 +/- 20 mg/day, and resulted in renal glomerular and tubular damage. Furthermore, renal tissue ANG II was not suppressed in the kidneys of SS rats fed 4.0\% NaCl. Administration of the immunosuppressive agent mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) prevented the infiltration of T lymphocytes and attenuated Dahl SS hypertension and renal disease. In contrast to vehicle-treated rats, Dahl SS rats administered MMF demonstrated a suppression of renal tissue ANG II from 163 +/- 26 to 88 +/- 9 pg/g of tissue when fed high salt. Finally, it was demonstrated that the T lymphocytes isolated from the kidney possess renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. These data indicate that infiltrating T cells are capable of participating in the production of ANG II and are associated with increased intrarenal ANG II, hypertension, and renal disease. The suppression of T-cell infiltration decreased intrarenal ANG II and prevented Dahl SS hypertension and kidney damage. As such, infiltrating cells are capable of participating in the established phase of Dahl SS hypertension.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension and its cardiovascular complications affect African Americans more severely than whites, a disparity variously ascribed to low birth weight, low glomerular number, an exaggerated arteriolonephrosclerotic blood pressure response, and inflammation-induced oxidative stress. Study Design: Case series. Setting and Participants: Autopsy kidneys of 107 African Americans and 87 whites aged 18 to 65 years at a single medical center between 1998 and 2005. Excluded were persons with known premorbid kidney disease; pathological findings of severe arterioarteriolonephrosclerosis, nodular and diffuse diabetic glomerulosclerosis, or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Predictors \& Outcomes: Associations of: (1) race, age, sex, birth weight, obesity, and glomerular number (predictors) with hypertension and death from coronary artery (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD; outcomes); and (2) age, blood pressure, and race (predictors) with arteriolonephrosclerotic changes, including chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation (outcomes). Measurements: Hypertension ascertained from chart review and heart weight. Cause of death determined from chart review and autopsy findings. Birth weight obtained from birth records (115 persons). Total glomerular number (Nglom) estimated by using the dissector/fractionator technique. Arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, cortical fibrosis, and chronic inflammation by using CD68 density were measured morphometrically. Results: 59 African Americans (55\%) and 32 whites (37\%) were classified as hypertensive. CAD and CVD were the cause of death in 64 (33\%) and 18 persons (9\%), respectively. By using multiple linear regression, birth weight (P {\textless} 0.001) and sex (P {\textless} 0.01), but not race (P = 0.3) or age (P = 0.2), predicted Nglom (P {\textless} 0.001; adjusted r2 = 0.176). Hypertension was associated with African American race (P = 0.04), older age (P {\textless} 0.001), and male sex (P = 0.01), but not with Nglom (P = 0.9), body mass index (P = 0.9), or birth weight (P = 0.4). Hypertension was the only significant factor associated with CAD and CVD (P {\textless} 0.001 for both). Interactions of age and blood pressure with race showed that although African Americans had more severe hypertension (P {\textless} 0.001) and arteriolosclerosis (P = 0.01) at a younger age than whites, there were no significant racial differences in degrees of arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, cortical fibrosis, or CD68 density for any level of increased blood pressure. Limitations: The study is observational and descriptive. Conclusions: The more severe hypertension found in African Americans could not be attributed to racial differences in Nglom or birth weight. CAD and CVD death and increased arteriolonephrosclerosis, including CD68 density, were determined by using blood pressure without a significant interacting contribution from race. © 2008 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that dysbiosis in gut microbiota is associated with hypertension because genetic, environmental, and dietary factors profoundly influence both gut microbiota and blood pressure. Bacterial DNA from fecal samples of 2 rat models of hypertension and a small cohort of patients was used for bacterial genomic analysis. We observed a significant decrease in microbial richness, diversity, and evenness in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, in addition to an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. These changes were accompanied by decreases in acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria. In addition, the microbiota of a small cohort of human hypertensive patients was found to follow a similar dysbiotic pattern, as it was less rich and diverse than that of control subjects. Similar changes in gut microbiota were observed in the chronic angiotensin II infusion rat model, most notably decreased microbial richness and an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. In this model, we evaluated the efficacy of oral minocycline in restoring gut microbiota. In addition to attenuating high blood pressure, minocycline was able to rebalance the dysbiotic hypertension gut microbiota by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. These observations demonstrate that high blood pressure is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, both in animal and human hypertension. They suggest that dietary intervention to correct gut microbiota could be an innovative nutritional therapeutic strategy for hypertension.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of disease activity and antirheumatic treatment on blood pressure (BP) in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: 508 patients with RA were randomised to receive (1) sequential monotherapy, (2) step-up combination therapy, (3) initial combination with prednisone or (4) with infliximab. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP), disease activity score (DAS) and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated every 3 months. A linear mixed model was used to model SBP and DBP in each treatment group during year 1, adjusting for baseline BP, changes in BMI, DAS and cardiovascular medication. Results: In all groups, mean SBP and DBP were lower for patients with DAS ≤2.4 than for patients with DAS {\textgreater}2.4. In addition, patients initially treated with infliximab (group 4) had a larger decrease in SBP and DBP over time than patients in groups 1-3. The decrease in BP was also observed in patients treated with infliximab after failure on conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in groups 1-3. The decrease in BP associated with treatment with infliximab occurred irrespective of the DAS response. Conclusion: A lower DAS is associated with lower BP. An additional decrease in BP was observed in patients treated with infliximab. Further research is needed to confirm the effect of infliximab on BP.},

	abstract = {Hypertension affects 30\% of adults and is the leading risk factor for heart attack and stroke. Traditionally, hypertension has been regarded as a disorder of two systems that are involved in the regulation of salt–water balance and cardiovascular function: the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, current treatments that aim to limit the influence of the RAAS or SNS on blood pressure fail in {\textasciitilde}40\% of cases, which suggests that other mechanisms must be involved. This Review summarizes the clinical and experimental evidence supporting a contribution of immune mechanisms to the development of hypertension. In this context, we highlight the immune cell subsets that are postulated to either promote or protect against hypertension through modulation of cardiac output and/or peripheral vascular resistance. We conclude with an appraisal of knowledge gaps still to be addressed before immunomodulatory therapies might be applied to at least a subset of patients with hypertension. This Review presents evidence that supports a role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including the immune cell subsets involved and the means by which these immune cells become activated throughout the course of the disease.},

However, the specific subsets of T cells that are important in this process are unknown. T helper 17 cells represent a novel subset that produces the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17). We found that angiotensin II infusion increased IL-17 production from T cells and IL-17 protein in the aortic media. To determine the effect of IL-17 on blood pressure and vascular function, we studied IL-17(-/-) mice. The initial hypertensive response to angiotensin II infusion was similar in IL-17(-/-) and C57BL/6J mice. However, hypertension was not sustained in IL-17(-/-) mice, reaching levels 30-mm Hg lower than in wild-type mice by 4 weeks of angiotensin II infusion. Vessels from IL-17(-/-) mice displayed preserved vascular function, decreased superoxide production, and reduced T-cell infiltration in response to angiotensin II. Gene array analysis of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells revealed that IL-17, in conjunction with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, modulated expression of {\textgreater}30 genes, including a number of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Examination of IL-17 in diabetic humans showed that serum levels of this cytokine were significantly increased in those with hypertension compared with normotensive subjects. We conclude that IL-17 is critical for the maintenance of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction and might be a therapeutic target for this widespread disease.},

We specifically studied whether anti-immune therapy, using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), could help prevent increases in renal NF-κB activation, renal infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, renal damage, decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow, and increases in arterial pressure. Seventy-four 7-to 8-wk-old Dahl S, Rapp strain rats were maintained on an 8\% Na, 8\% Na + MMF (20 mg·kg $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ·day $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ), 0.3\% Na, or 0.3\% Na + MMF diet for 5 wk. Arterial and venous catheters were implanted at day 21. By day 35, renal NF-κB in 8\% Na rats was 47\% higher than in 0.3\% Na rats and renal NF-κB was 41\% lower in 8\% Na + MMF rats compared with the 8\% Na group. MMF treatment significantly decreased renal monocyte/macrophage infiltration and renal damage and increased GFR and renal plasma flow. In high-NA Dahl S rats mean arterial pressure increased to 182 ± 5 mmHg, and MMF reduced this arterial pressure to 124 ± 3 mmHg. In summary, in Dahl S rats on high sodium intake, treatment with MMF decreases renal NF-κB and renal monocyte/macrophage infiltration and improves renal function, lessens renal injury, and decreases arterial pressure. This suggests that renal infiltration of immune cells is associated with increased arterial pressure and renal damage and decreasing GFR and renal plasma flow in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We have previously shown that reduction of this infiltrate results in prevention of salt-sensitive hypertension induced by short-term angiotensin II infusion and nitric oxide inhibition (Quiroz Y, Pons H, Gordon KI, Rincón J, Chávez M, Parra G, Herrera-Acosta J, Gómez-Garre D, Largo R, Egido J, Johnson RJ, and Rodrı́guez-Iturbe B.

We therefore studied whether hypertension could be controlled in genetically hypertensive rats [spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)] by the administration of 20 mg · kg $^{\textrm{−1}}$ · day $^{\textrm{−1}}$ of the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF group; n = 35). Other SHR received vehicle ( n= 35), and Wistar-Kyoto rats ( n = 20) were used as controls. MMF or vehicle was given in two separate 4-wk periods, separated by a 3-wk interval. Systemic hypertension was reduced to normal levels in both periods of MMF treatment in association with a reduction in lymphocyte, macrophage, and angiotensin II-positive cells infiltrating the kidney. Oxidative stress was also reduced by MMF, as indicated by a reduction in urinary malondialdehyde (MDA), renal MDA content, and superoxide-positive cells, and was highly correlated with blood pressure levels. We conclude that the renal immune infiltrate plays a major role in the hypertension in SHR. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Infliximab significantly reduced the 24-h systolic BP (SBP) from 127.4±21.8 to 120.1±23.4 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.0001). Particularly, morning BP (0600-0800 h) decreased from 129.7±19.7 to 116.9±13.4 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.0001), and daytime BP decreased from 131.8±15.1 to 122.5±13.7 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.0001).

The reduction in morning SBP correlated with the reduction in the norepinephrine level (P{\textless}0.05) but not with that in PRA and inflammatory parameters related to RA.

For addressing this issue, patients who were prescribed by their private physicians mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the treatment of psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis and had, in addition, grade I essential hypertension and normal renal function were studied. Eight patients were studied before MMF was started, during MMF treatment, and 1 mo after MMF treatment had been discontinued. Other treatments and diet were unchanged in the three phases of the study. MMF therapy was associated with a significant reduction in systolic, diastolic, and mean BP. Urinary excretion of TNF-alpha was reduced progressively by MMF treatment and increased after MMF was discontinued.

This population-based longitudinal study explored whether C3 or C4 is associated with development of hypertension. Blood pressure and plasma levels of C3 and C4 were determined in 2178 healthy men, aged 35-50 years, initially without treatment for hypertension. Incidence of hypertension and blood pressure increase over 15.7 (+/-2.2) years follow-up was studied in relation to C3 and C4 at baseline. Among men with initially normal blood pressure ({\textless}160/95 mm Hg), incidence of hypertension ({\textgreater}or=160/95 mm Hg or treatment) was 32, 42, 37 and 47\%, respectively, for men with C3 in the first, second, third and fourth quartile (trend: P=0.001). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Among men without blood pressure treatment, systolic BP increase (mean+standard error, adjusted for age, initial blood pressure and follow-up time) was 17.5+0.8, 19.6+0.9, 19.8+0.8 and 20.8+0.8 mm Hg, respectively, in the C3 quartiles (trend: P=0.004). C3 was not associated diastolic blood pressure at follow-up. Although C4 was associated with blood pressure at the baseline examination, there was no relationship between C4 and development of hypertension or future blood pressure increase.

We show that mice lacking T and B cells (RAG-1-/- mice) have blunted hypertension and do not develop abnormalities of vascular function during angiotensin II infusion or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt. Adoptive transfer of T, but not B, cells restored these abnormalities. Angiotensin II is known to stimulate reactive oxygen species production via the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in several cells, including some immune cells. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of T cells lacking the angiotensin type I receptor or a functional NADPH oxidase resulted in blunted angiotensin II-dependent hypertension and decreased aortic superoxide production. Angiotensin II increased T cell markers of activation and tissue homing in wild-type, but not NADPH oxidase-deficient, mice. Angiotensin II markedly increased T cells in the perivascular adipose tissue (periadventitial fat) and, to a lesser extent the adventitia. These cells expressed high levels of CC chemokine receptor 5 and were commonly double negative (CD3+CD4-CD8-). This infiltration was associated with an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and RANTES in the aorta. Hypertension also increased T lymphocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and treatment with the TNFα antagonist etanercept prevented the hypertension and increase in vascular superoxide caused by angiotensin II. These studies identify a previously undefined role for T cells in the genesis of hypertension and support a role of inflammation in the basis of this prevalent disease. T cells might represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of high blood pressure. JEM © The Rockefeller University Press.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE Accumulating evidence supports a role of adaptive immunity and particularly T cells in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Formation of memory T cells, which requires the costimulatory molecule CD70 on antigen-presenting cells, is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that CD70 and immunologic memory contribute to the blood pressure elevation and renal dysfunction mediated by repeated hypertensive challenges. METHODS AND RESULTS We imposed repeated hypertensive challenges using either N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)/high salt or repeated angiotensin II stimulation in mice. During these challenges effector memory T cells (T(EM)) accumulated in the kidney and bone marrow. In the L-NAME/high-salt model, memory T cells of the kidney were predominant sources of interferon-γ and interleukin-17A, known to contribute to hypertension. L-NAME/high salt increased macrophage and dendritic cell surface expression of CD70 by 3- to 5-fold. Mice lacking CD70 did not accumulate T(EM) cells and did not develop hypertension to either high salt or the second angiotensin II challenge and were protected against renal damage. Bone marrow-residing T(EM) cells proliferated and redistributed to the kidney in response to repeated salt feeding. Adoptively transferred T(EM) cells from hypertensive mice homed to the bone marrow and spleen and expanded on salt feeding of the recipient mice. CONCLUSIONS Our findings illustrate a previously undefined role of CD70 and long-lived T(EM) cells in the development of blood pressure elevation and end-organ damage that occur on delayed exposure to mild hypertensive stimuli. Interventions to prevent repeated hypertensive surges could attenuate formation of hypertension-specific T(EM) cells.},

	abstract = {Aims Immune system activation is a common feature of hypertension pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms that initiate this activation are not well understood. Innate immune system recognition and response to danger are becoming apparent in many cardiovascular diseases. Danger signals can arise from not only pathogens, but also damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Our first hypothesis was that the DAMP, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), is elevated in the circulation of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and that the deoxyribonuclease enzymes responsible for its degradation have decreased activity in SHR. Based on these novel SHR phenotypes, we further hypothesized that (i) treatment of SHR with an inhibitory oligodinucleotide for TLR9 (ODN2088) would lower blood pressure and that (ii) treatment of normotensive rats with a TLR9-specific CpG oligonucleotide (ODN2395) would cause endothelial dysfunction and increase blood pressure. Methods and results We observed that SHR have elevated circulating mtDNA and diminished deoxyribonuclease I and II activity. Additionally, treatment of SHR with ODN2088 lowered systolic blood pressure. On the other hand, treatment of normotensive rats with ODN2395 increased systolic blood pressure and rendered their arteries less sensitive to acetylcholine-induced relaxation and more sensitive to norepinephrine-induced contraction. This dysfunctional vasoreactivity was due to increased cyclooxygenase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, increased reactive oxygen species generation, and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability. Conclusion Circulating mtDNA and impaired deoxyribonuclease activity may lead to the activation of the innate immune system, via TLR9, and contribute to elevated arterial pressure and vascular dysfunction in SHR.},

However, little attention has been paid to prehypertension. Complement C3 is a central hub of complement-related immune system. We examined the association between C3 and prehypertension in an adult population for the first time, aiming to investigate whether pro-inflammatory immune response is involved in the prehypertensive state. About 7820 Tianjin residents without hypertension were categorized into sex-specific quintiles based on their serum concentration of complement C3. Adjusted logistic regression models were used separately by gender to assess the association between C3 quintiles and the prevalence of prehypertension. After multiple adjustment, the odds ratios (95\% confidence interval) for prehypertension across increasing quintiles of C3 were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.84, 1.25), 1.15 (0.94, 1.42), 1.25 (1.01, 1.54), and 1.71 (1.35, 2.17) (p for trend {\textless} 0.0001) among men and were 1.00 (reference), 1.17 (0.92, 1.49), 1.13 (0.88, 1.44), 1.15 (0.89, 1.48), and 1.40 (1.07, 1.84) (p for trend = 0.03) among women. The findings suggested that elevated serum C3 levels are associated with prehypertension.

	abstract = {Objective: Recent studies have implicated an enhanced secretion of IL1β through activation of the Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3)-inflammasome as the pro-inflammatory signal in animal models of the gout, chronic kidney disease (CKD), atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its contribution to hypertension is not established. We aimed to demonstrate the role of the Nlrp3-inflammasome in the two-kidneys, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt model of hypertension in Nlrp3-/- and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (Asc)-/- and wild type control male mice. Study design: 2K1C hypertension was generated by narrowing left renal artery using U-shaped stainless steel clip. BP and heart rate were recorded intra-arterially with a computerized data-acquisition system in conscious mice. Plasma renin activity and concentration were measured by radioimmunoassay. Renal transcript levels of Nlrp3, Asc, Casp1, IL1A, IL1β, and IL6 were assessed by RT-Q-PCR. Results: Results show that Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice are protected from developing hypertension and have lower circulating levels of plasma renin and serum amyloid A (SAA) and IL6, in comparison to wild type (WT) control mice. RNA levels of SAA, Nlrp3, and IL1β are increased in the ischemic kidney of the WT control mice. Administration of anti-IL1β antibody to the WT control mice attenuated the increase of blood pressure and renin in the 2K1C model. The results suggest that NALP3 inflammasome has an impact on blood pressure and renin secretion during renal hypoperfusion induced by renal arterial clip and contributes to renin-dependent renovascular hypertension. Conclusion: These findings show that Nlrp3-inflammasome mediated production of IL1 is linked to the development of renovascular hypertension and might be a novel target for the treatment of renovascular hypertension, CKD and other inflammatory diseases with hypertension.},

	abstract = {AIMS Hypertension is associated with increased levels of circulating cytokines and recent studies have shown that innate immunity contributes to hypertension. The mechanisms which hypertension stimulates immune response remain unclear, but may involve formation of neo-antigens that activate the immune system. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an innate immune receptor that binds a wide spectrum of exogenous (lipopolysaccharide) and endogenous ligands. TLR4 signaling leads to activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and transcription of genes involved in inflammatory response. We previously demonstrated that TLR4 blockade reduces blood pressure and the augmented vascular contractility in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Here we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4 ameliorates the vascular inflammatory process by a NFκB signaling pathway. MAIN METHODS SHR and Wistar rats were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody (1μg/day) or unspecific IgG for 15days (i.p.). KEY FINDINGS Anti-TLR4 treatment decreased production of reactive oxygen species and expression of IL-6 cytokine in mesenteric resistance arteries from SHR, when compared with IgG-treated SHR. Anti-TLR4 treatment also abolished the increased vascular reactivity to noradrenaline observed in IgG-treated SHR, as described before, and inhibition of NFκB decreased noradrenaline responses only in IgG-treated SHR. Mesenteric arteries from SHR treated with anti-TLR4 displayed decreased expression of MyD88, but not TRIF, key molecules in TLR4 signaling. Phosphorylation of p38 and NF-κB p65 were decreased in arteries from anti-TLR4-treated SHR versus IgG-treated SHR. SIGNIFICANCE Together, these results suggest that TLR4 is a key player in hypertension and vascular inflammatory process by a NFκB signaling pathway.},

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling contributes to inflammatory cardiovascular and renal diseases, but its role in Aldo-induced hypertension and renal damage is not clear. In the current study, rats were treated with Aldo-salt combined with TAK-242 (a TLR4 signaling antagonist) for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic, cardiac and renal parameters were assayed at the indicated time. We found that Aldo-salt-treated rats present cardiac and renal hypertrophy and dysfunction. Cardiac and renal expression levels of TLR4 as well as levels of molecular markers attesting inflammation and fibrosis are increased by Aldo infusion, whereas the treatment of TAK-242 reverses these alterations. TAK-242 suppresses cardiac and renal inflammatory cytokines levels (TNF-a, IL-1β and MCP-1). Furthermore, TAK-242 inhibits hypertension, cardiac and renal fibrosis, and also attenuates the Aldo-induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). In experimental hyperaldosteronism, upregulation of TLR4 is correlated with cardiac and renal fibrosis and dysfunction, and a TLR4 signaling antagonist, TAK-242, can reverse these alterations. TAK-242 may be a therapeutic option for salt-sensitive hypertension and renal fibrosis.},

Despite the importance of hypertension, the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, which involves the complex interaction of several mechanisms, is still poorly understood. Evidence suggests that interplay between bone marrow, microglia and immune mediators underlies the development of arterial hypertension, in particular through mechanisms involving cytokines and peptides, such as neuropeptide Y, substance P, angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7). Chronic psychological stress also seems to have a role in increasing the risk of hypertension, probably through the activation of neuroimmune pathways.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Angiotensin II (ATII), a potent vasoconstrictor, causes hypertension, promotes infiltration of myelomonocytic cells into the vessel wall, and stimulates both vascular and inflammatory cell NADPH oxidases. The predominant source of reactive oxygen species, eg, vascular (endothelial, smooth muscle, adventitial) versus phagocytic NADPH oxidase, and the role of myelomonocytic cells in mediating arterial hypertension have not been defined yet. METHODS AND RESULTS Angiotensin II (1 mg · kg(-1) · d(-1) for 7 days) increased the number of both CD11b(+)Gr-1(low)F4/80(+) macrophages and CD11b(+)Gr-1(high)F4/80(-) neutrophils in mouse aorta (verified by flow cytometry). Selective ablation of lysozyme M-positive (LysM(+)) myelomonocytic cells by low-dose diphtheria toxin in mice with inducible expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor (LysM(iDTR) mice) reduced the number of monocytes in the circulation and limited ATII-induced infiltration of these cells into the vascular wall, whereas the number of neutrophils was not reduced. Depletion of LysM(+) cells attenuated ATII-induced blood pressure increase (measured by radiotelemetry) and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction (assessed by aortic ring relaxation studies) and reduced vascular superoxide formation (measured by chemiluminescence, cytochrome c assay, and oxidative fluorescence microtopography) and the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits gp91(phox) and p67(phox) (assessed by Western blot and mRNA reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction). Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) monocytes into depleted LysM(iDTR) mice reestablished ATII-induced vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and arterial hypertension, whereas transfer of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) neutrophils or monocytes from gp91(phox) or ATII receptor type 1 knockout mice did not. CONCLUSIONS- Infiltrating monocytes with a proinflammatory phenotype and macrophages rather than neutrophils appear to be essential for ATII-induced vascular dysfunction and arterial hypertension.},

We determined the in vitro secretion patterns of proinflammatory cytokines obtained from isolated peripheral monocytes from normal controls and from hypertensive patients either after in vitro stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II) with or without preincubation with an Ang II type I receptor antagonist (losartan) or after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Blood samples were obtained from 22 patients with essential hypertension (before any drug administration or after interruption of antihypertensive therapy) and from 24 normotensive healthy individuals used as a control group. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and plastic adherence. The state of monocyte activity was determined by the capacity to secrete tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL- 1β), and interleukin-6, (IL-6) either spontaneously or after stimulation. Cytokine concentrations were determined in culture supernatants by specific ELISA. Proinflammatory cytokine levels were assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction. After stimulation with Ang II, the IL-1β secretion of peripheral blood monocytes was significantly increased in hypertensive patients versus healthy individuals (P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, in monocytes preincubated with losartan before exposure to Ang II, IL-1β secretion was diminished in both groups to comparable levels. The secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α was significantly increased in peripheral blood monocytes from hypertensive patients versus healthy individuals after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (TNF-α, P{\textless}0.02; IL-1β, P{\textless}0.05). Upregulation of IL-1β and TNF-α secretion in peripheral blood monocytes from hypertensive patients was also seen at the RNA level.

	abstract = {Plasma levels of IL-6 correlate with high blood pressure under many circumstances, and ANG II has been shown to stimulate IL-6 production from various cell types. This study tested the role of IL-6 in mediating the hypertension caused by high-dose ANG II and a high-salt diet. Male C57BL6 and IL-6 knockout (IL-6 KO) mice were implanted with biotelemetry devices and placed in metabolic cages to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), sodium balance, and urinary albumin excretion. Baseline MAP during the control period averaged 114 ± 1 and 109 ± 1 mmHg for wild-type (WT) and IL-6 KO mice, respectively, and did not change significantly when the mice were placed on a high-salt diet (HS; 4\% NaCl). ANG II (90 ng/min sc) caused a rapid increase in MAP in both groups, to 141 ± 9 and 141 ± 4 in WT and KO mice, respectively, on day 2. MAP plateaued at this level in KO mice (134 ± 2 mmHg on day 14 of ANG II) but began to increase further in WT mice by day 4, reaching an average of 160 ± 4 mmHg from days 10 to 14 of ANG II. Urinary albumin excretion on day 4 of ANG II was not different between groups (9.18 ± 4.34 and 8.53 ± 2.85 μg/2 days for WT and KO mice). By day 14, albumin excretion was nearly fourfold greater in WT mice, but MAP dropped rapidly back to control levels in both groups when the ANG II was stopped after 14 days. Thus the ∼30 mmHg greater ANG II hypertension in the WT mice suggests that IL-6 contributes significantly to ANG II-salt hypertension. In addition, the early separation in MAP, the albumin excretion data, and the rapid, post-ANG II recovery of MAP suggest an IL-6-dependent mechanism that is independent of renal injury.},

However, the association between HBP and other inflammatory markers, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis alpha (TNF-α), has not been evaluated in well-controlled studies. We examined the cross-sectional relationship between IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP and HBP in a random sample of 196 healthy subjects. All markers were measured in duplicate with high-sensitivity ELISA tests. Three blood pressure (BP) measurments were averaged for the analysis, and subjects with systolic BP ⩾140 and/or diastolic BP ⩾90 mmHg were considered hypertensive. Log binomial regression was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) of HBP. Of the subjects, 40\% (79) were hypertensive (mean age: 44 years; range 30–64). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, family history of HBP, and the level of the other inflammatory markers, subjects in the second (PR: 3.10, P=0.003), third (PR: 2.32; P=0.031), and fourth quartiles (PR: 2.30; P=0.036) of IL-6 were more than twice as likely to be hypertensive than those in the first quartile. Corresponding PR estimates for TNF-α levels were 1.41 (P=0.014) for the second; 1.59 (P=0.001) for the third; and 1.61 (P=0.025) for the fourth quartile. The CRP–HBP association was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that TNF-α and IL-6 could be independent risk factors for HBP in apparently healthy subjects. Nevertheless, the temporal relationship between elevated inflammation markers and HBP should be ascertained in prospective cohort studies.},

The level of blood pressure and the prognosis were not influenced by the presence of thymus within the first 3 months after partial infarction of the kidney; but a significantly more pronounced increase in blood pressure after 4 months was observed in a small group of haired mice than in a similarly treated small group of nude mice. A marked degree of round cell infiltration around intrarenal arteries was only found in the haired mice, commencing 2 months after partial infarction of the kidney. Degenerative changes were observed in the kidneys of the haired mice 2-4 months after infarction. Very few of these lesions were found in the nude mice. Atempts to transfer the hypertension by means of viable lymph node cells from hypertensive donors to normotensive syngeneic recipients failed. The results support the assumption that high intravascular pressure induces thymus-dependent immune reactions against substances in teh vascular walls which, in turn, may have a prognostic significane; the results give no support for the assumption that the earlier phase of the hypertension which follows partial infarction of the kidney and contralateral nephrectomy is thymus-dependent.},

Contemporary advances in experimentation have permitted a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which inflammation and immunity participate in cardiovascular disease, and multiple observations have demonstrated strong correlations between the discoveries made in animals and those made in patients with hypertension. Of note, striking phenotypic similarities have been observed in the infiltration of immune cells in the kidney and the development of end-organ damage in patients and animal models with sodium-sensitive hypertension. The available data suggest that an initial salt-induced increase in renal perfusion pressure, which is likely independent of immune mechanisms, induces the infiltration of immune cells into the kidney. The mechanisms mediating immune cell infiltration in the kidney are not well understood but likely involve tissue damage, the direct influence of salt to stimulate immune cell activation, sympathetic nerve stimulation or other factors. The infiltrating cells then release cytokines, free radicals and other factors that contribute to renal damage as well as increased retention of sodium and water and vascular resistance, which lead to the further development of hypertension.},

              prolongation, following the removal of drugs due to torsades de pointes (
              TdP
              ). Although this has improved our understanding of drug‐induced

              QT
              prolongation in clinical practice using a simple risk assessment approach. Accurate measurement of the
              QT
              interval is best done manually, and not using the measurement of standard
              ECG
              machines. Correction for heart rate (

              ) using correction formulae such as
              B
              azett's is often inaccurate. These formulae underestimate and overestimate the duration of cardiac repolarization at low and high heart rates, respectively. Numerous cut‐offs have been suggested as an indicator of an abnormal
              QT
              , but are problematic in clinical practice. An alternative approach is the
              QT
              nomogram which is a plot of

              QT‐HR
              pairs above this line have been shown in a systematic study to be associated with
              TdP
              and the line is more sensitive and specific than

	abstract = {Background: Although QT prolongation is associated with increased risk of torsade de pointes (TdP), the precise relationship is not well defined.Aim: To evaluate the performance of a QT nomogram in assessing the risk of TdP from QT–RR combinations.Design: Systematic review.Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE/EMBASE for cases of drug-induced TdP. Controls were patients taking non-cardiotoxic drugs in overdose. Inclusion criteria were definite TdP, normal ECG before or after the event, association with a drug/toxin and QT–RR measurements available. The upper bound of a QT–RR cloud diagram developed from human preclinical studies was converted into a QT nomogram [QT vs. heart rate (HR)]. QT–HR combinations for TdP cases and controls were plotted with the QT nomogram, and curves corresponding to a QTc = 440 ms and QTc = 500 ms for comparison (Bazett's correction).Results: We identified 129 cases of TdP. TdP cases occurred at lower HR values with longer QT intervals, with most cases occurring at HR 30–90 bpm. Controls were more evenly distributed, with HR 40–160 bpm. The sensitivity and specificity of the QT nomogram were 96.9\% (95\%CI 93.9–99.9) and 98.7\% (95\%CI 96.8–100), respectively. For Bazett QTc = 440 ms, sensitivity and specificity were 98.5\% (95\%CI 96.3–100) and 66.7\% (95\%CI 58.6–74.7), respectively, whereas for Bazett QTc =500 ms they were 93.8\% (95\%CI 89.6–98.0) and 97.2\% (95\%CI 94.3–100), respectively.Discussion: The QT nomogram is a clinically relevant risk assessment tool that accurately predicts arrhythmogenic risk for drug-induced QT prolongation. Further prospective evaluation of the nomogram is needed.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The impact of oral anticoagulants (OACs) on the need of long-term care (LTC) in the aging and multimorbid population of patients with atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is unknown. We conducted a nationwide cohort study to evaluate the effect of OACs on the need of LTC. Design: Retrospective nationwide cohort study. Setting and Participants: The registry-based FinACAF cohort study covers all patients with incident AF from all levels of care in Finland from 2007 to 2018, as well as all their OAC purchases, LTC admissions, and information on previous home care acuity.
Methods: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of LTC admission were calculated using Poisson regression models with a Lexis-type data structure based on 3 time scales: follow-up time from AF diagnosis, calendar year, and age.
Results: We identiﬁed 188,752 patients (49.0\% female; mean age 71.4 years; mean follow-up 3.6 years) with incident AF without prior LTC, of whom 143,534 (76.0 \%) initiated OAC therapy and 11,775 (6.2 \%) were admitted to LTC. OAC therapy was associated with lower rates of LTC admission (adjusted IRR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.76-0.82). When compared to warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were associated with lower LTC admission rate (adjusted IRR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.61-0.79). No signiﬁcant disparities were observed between different DOACs.
Conclusions and Implications: OAC therapy, particularly with DOACs, is associated with a substantially lower risk of admission to LTC in patients with AF. Increasing guideline-based OAC coverage among patients with AF may prevent the need of LTC, lengthen survival at home, and potentially decrease health care costs.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to identify optimal blood pressure cut-offs to diagnose orthostatic hypotension during a sit-to-stand manoeuvre.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients and healthy controls from the Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Center. Blood pressure was measured while supine, seated and standing. Blood pressure changes were calculated from supine-to-standing and seated-to-standing. Orthostatic hypotension was diagnosed on the basis of a supine-to-standing SBP drop at least 20 mmHg or a DBP drop at least 10 mmHg. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves identified optimal sit-to-stand cut-offs.
Results: Amongst the 831 individuals, more had systolic orthostatic hypotension [n ¼ 354 (43\%)] than diastolic orthostatic hypotension [n ¼ 305 (37\%)] during lying-tostanding. The ROC curves had good characteristics [SBP area under curve ¼ 0.916 (95\% confidence interval: 0.896–0.936), P {\textless} 0.001; DBP area under curve ¼ 0.930 (95\% confidence interval: 0.909–0.950), P {\textless} 0.001]. A sitto stand SBP drop at least 15 mmHg had optimal test characteristics (sensitivity ¼ 80.2\%; specificity ¼ 88.9\%; positive predictive value ¼ 84.2\%; negative predictive value ¼ 85.8\%), as did a DBP drop at least 7 mmHg (sensitivity ¼ 87.2\%; specificity ¼ 87.2\%; positive predictive value ¼ 80.1\%; negative predictive value ¼ 92.0\%).
Conclusions: A sit-to-stand manoeuvre with lower diagnostic cut-offs for orthostatic hypotension provides a simple screening test for orthostatic hypotension in situations wherein a supine-to-standing manoeuvre cannot be easily performed. Our analysis suggests that a SBP drop at least 15 mmHg or a DBP drop at least 7 mmHg best optimizes sensitivity and specificity of this sit-to-stand test.},

This article introduces a model of qualitative variation in constructive alignment, and uses the results from known alignment studies to test the model. The research reviewed reveals that university teachers have at least two qualitatively different experiences of the core elements of constructive alignment. The teachers who describe their approaches to teaching as involving conceptual change/development intentions with student-focused strategies were found to be likely to see the intended learning outcomes for students in more holistic terms, and assessment as an integral part of that teaching approach. When teachers had more of an intention to transfer information using teacherfocused strategies, they saw the object of study more in terms of parts (concepts, deﬁnitions, formulae) with assessment focused on those parts. The implications of this qualitative variation in constructive alignment for curriculum design and for the quality of the outcomes of student learning is discussed.},

              High sodium concentration alters leukocyte activation, and in particular T‐helper (Th) lymphocyte polarization, and drives the development of autoimmune diseases in mouse studies. Similar results have been obtained with human leukocytes under
              in vitro
              settings and in few observational studies. Therefore, salt has been implicated as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases. Here, we examined whether physiologically relevant changes in salt intake or diet alter cytokine concentrations. In a 20‐wk double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study 106 participants were randomized to Habitual and Healthy Nordic diets, and further to Usual Sodium and Reduced Sodium intake groups using a cross‐over setup. Plasma concentrations of 45 cytokines were measured at three different time‐points using a multiplex assay. Repeated analyses of covariance revealed that high salt ingestion (or changes in the diet) did not induce significant changes in any of the signature cytokines controlling Th1, Th2 or Th17 polarization. Several other pro‐inflammatory interleukins, chemokines and growth factors were also unaffected by the level of salt intake or changes in the diet. We conclude that in humans clinically relevant changes in salt intake or diet do not have reflections on the systemic concentrations of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in vivo.},

	abstract = {High blood pressure is present in more than one billion adults worldwide and is the most important modifiable risk factor of death resulting from cardiovascular disease. While many factors contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, a role of the immune system has been firmly established by a large number of investigations from many laboratories around the world. Immunosuppressive drugs and inhibition of individual cytokines prevent or ameliorate experimental hypertension, and studies in genetically-modified mouse strains have demonstrated that lymphocytes are necessary participants in the development of hypertension and in hypertensive organ injury. Furthermore, immune reactivity may be the driving force of hypertension in autoimmune diseases. Infiltration of immune cells, oxidative stress, and stimulation of the intrarenal angiotensin system are induced by activation of the innate and adaptive immunity. High blood pressure results from the combined effects of inflammation-induced impairment in the pressure natriuresis relationship, dysfunctional vascular relaxation, and overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Imbalances between proinflammatory effector responses and anti-inflammatory responses of regulatory T cells to a large extent determine the severity of inflammation. Experimental and human studies have uncovered autoantigens (isoketal-modified proteins and heat shock protein 70) of potential clinical relevance. Further investigations on the immune reactivity in hypertension may result in the identification of new strategies for the treatment of the disease.},

Until recently, there have been few studies of lecturers’ approaches to teaching in higher education and their relationship with conceptions of teaching. This study aimed to characterise the alternative approaches to teaching of university lecturers, and to examine the relationship between lecturers’ approaches to teaching and their conceptions of good teaching. This study adopted an open naturalistic approach. Seventeen lecturers in three departments in a university were selected for interview based on their rank, years of teaching and industrial or professional experience. Lecturers were interviewed individually about their conceptions of good teaching, motivational strategies and effective teaching. The interview records were then content analysed by the two researchers of the study. The study found that (a) it was possible to characterise lecturers’ approaches to teaching with one motivation and ﬁve strategy dimensions; (b) the conceptions of teaching of the lecturers were best described by two main orientations of transmissive and facilitative teaching; (c) lecturers who conceived teaching as transmitting knowledge were more likely to use content-centred approaches to teaching, while those who conceived teaching as facilitative tended to use learning-centred approaches. The study concludes by suggesting that fundamental changes to the quality of teaching and learning are unlikely to happen without changes to lecturers’ conception of teaching.},

	abstract = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recoding of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacitylimited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

In this study, we focus on the work-related learning processes reported by experienced higher education teachers. The aim of this study was to discover whether teachers actively self-regulate their learning experiences (as their students are expected to do) and to examine how this regulation takes place in the workplace. We tested some generally held assumptions and conceptions regarding teacher learning. Fifteen experienced college teachers, from three diﬀerent colleges in The Netherlands, participated. Two semi-structured interviews and a (digital) diary study were used as the primary data collection methods. We collected 86 examples of teacher learning episodes. These were analysed using a phenomenographic method. The results show that our teachers’ learning experiences are not as self-regulated, planned, reﬂective, or spiral as some assume. Sometimes, the teachers’ learning was planned (self-regulated), but mostly it occurred in a non-linear (both external and self-regulated) or spontaneous (externally regulated) way. We conclude that our teachers do not always self-regulate their learning, but they mostly do self-regulate their teaching practice (with learning as a result).},

	abstract = {This study explored university students’ views of whether they will need research skills in their future work in relation to their approaches to learning, situational orientations on a learning situation of quantitative methods, and difﬁculties experienced in quantitative research courses. Education and psychology students in both Finland (N = 46) and the USA (N = 122), who thought that they would need research skills in their future work, differed signiﬁcantly from the students who were not sure whether they would need these skills. The students, who considered research skills important for their future work, were more task-oriented, used a deeper approach to learning and experienced fewer difﬁculties in the learning of research skills than other students. This ﬁnding implies that experiences in learning, learning approaches and situational orientations are related to expectations about future work. For instruction, this means that if we were somehow able to change students’ experiences and orientations towards research into a more positive direction, students might be better prepared for their future work.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent research on learning patterns of student teachers and experienced teachers, mostly in the context of educational innovation and teachers' professional development. The discussion is structured along a model of teacher learning patterns comprising learning activities, regulation of learning, beliefs on own learning about teaching, motivations to learn about teaching, learning outcomes, and personal and contextual factors. A learning pattern is conceived as a coherent whole of learning activities that learners usually employ, their beliefs about own learning and their learning motivation; a whole that is characteristic of them in a certain period. Patterns in teacher learning across studies are identiﬁed and problematic aspects of teacher learning are discussed. It is concluded that teachers differ in the learning patterns they adopt, and that these patterns differ with regard to the quality of teacher learning and professional development in the context of adaptation to educational change and innovations. Implications for fostering teacher learning are derived.},

Systems may not be set up to facilitate good delirium practice and staff may have low baseline understanding of how to spot, stop and treat delirium. In this context, delirium guidelines are especially important. In this article, we review the 2021 Australian Delirium Clinical Care Standards. The care standards are different to guidelines insofar as they focus on main presentations and represent eight quality statements describing the best evidence-based care patients with delirium should be offered.The standards speak to three different audiences: consumer, clinician and healthcare organisations. As such, they provide some system-level solutions to practice-level problems. They incorporate latest evidence and reflect the sway away from prescribing to treat delirium, stating that antipsychotics should be avoided. Furthermore, they promote inclusivity of families and carers in delirium care processes as an important medium to engender good practice.Limitations include the fact that they extend to delirium in multiple settings where different approaches may be necessary. They also lack the granularity of being able to provide recommendations on a greater range of drugs that might be used and assume settings are ready to introduce best delirium practice.In sum, they represent an important step forward for delirium knowledge translation and are particularly relevant for patients in the geriatric setting. The guidelines though are constrained as to what they can advocate due to research gaps especially into treatment of delirium.},

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is one of the key chemokines that regulate migration and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages. Both CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 have been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases. Migration of monocytes from the blood stream across the vascular endothelium is required for routine immunological surveillance of tissues, as well as in response to inflammation.

Thus, it is of great importance to understand how people are ageing and if the trajectories of health and disability are changing over time. This study aimed to examine trends in functional abilities and health in independent cohorts of people aged 75-95 over three decades. Methods: This Helsinki Ageing Study consists of repeated cross-sectional postal surveys examining independent cohorts of old people (75, 80, 85 and 90+ years old). This study combined data from four waves (1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019). Results: In the most recent wave, there was an increase in the portion of participants who were able to walk outdoors easily (75-year-olds p=0.03, 80-year-olds p=0.002, 85-year-olds p{\textless}0.001; p for linearity for the study year effect, all adjusted for sex). Fewer people in the youngest age group (75-year-olds) needed daily help from another person in 2019 compared to the earlier waves (p=0.02 for linearity for the study year). Over the past three decades, the proportions of self-reported good mobility have risen 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-15.1) in 75-year-olds, 11.7\% (95\% CI 3.9-19.6) in 80-year-olds and 20.1\% (95\% CI 10.7-29.4) in 85-year-olds, after adjusting for sex. Furthermore, in 2019, more people rated their health as good and scored better in psychological well-being than in the previous waves among 75-, 80- and 85-year-olds. However, no improvements were found among 90+-year-olds in any of these variables. Conclusions: People between 75 and 85 years old are presently feeling and functioning better than their predecessors. This may be an important objective for both economics and health policy.},

To do so, we compared data obtained 20 years apart in the Berlin Aging Study (in 1990-1993) and the Berlin Aging Study II (in 2013-2014), applied a case-matched control design (per cohort, n = 161, Mage = 75), quantified sample selection using a nationally representative sample as the reference, and controlled for number of physical diseases. The later cohort performed better on the fluid intelligence measure (d = .85) and reported higher morale, less negative affect, and more positive affect (ds {\textgreater} .39) than the earlier cohort. We concluded that secular advances have resulted in better cognitive performance and perceived quality of life among older adults and discuss when and how advantages of later cohorts reach their limits.},

	abstract = {Context: Age, period and birth cohort (APC) effects have been known for decades in biological, health and social sciences. However, exact collinearity between these three (Age = Year - Birth Year) leads to difficulty estimating these effects. It is thus impossible to estimate linear components of these effects without strong assumptions about at least one of these. This is problematic for anyone interested in APC patterns. Attempts to 'solve' this identification problem without strong assumptions are, in fact, making hidden unintended assumptions.Objective: Provide an overview of what APC effects are and the nature of the identification problem, before reviewing and critiquing methodological literature across the health and social sciences. I also present an argument for what researchers should do.Method: Non-systematic review of methodological literature across health and social sciences.Results: Recommendations include considering non-linearities around linear APC effects and stating strong and explicit theory-based assumptions. Mechanical solutions to the identification problem do not work.Conclusion: These recommendations acknowledge there is a 'line of solutions' of possible combinations of APC effects, and not a single answer that can be estimated empirically. None of these methods solve the identification problem - rather they acknowledge that methods are limited by assumptions.},

	abstract = {Background
A rapidly increasing proportion of people in high-income countries are surviving into their tenth decade. Concern is widespread that the basis for this development is the survival of frail and disabled elderly people into very old age. To investigate this issue, we compared the cognitive and physical functioning of two cohorts of Danish nonagenarians, born 10 years apart.
Methods
People in the first cohort were born in 1905 and assessed at age 93 years (n=2262); those in the second cohort were born in 1915 and assessed at age 95 years (n=1584). All cohort members were eligible irrespective of type of residence. Both cohorts were assessed by surveys that used the same design and assessment instrument, and had almost identical response rates (63\%). Cognitive functioning was assessed by mini-mental state examination and a composite of five cognitive tests that are sensitive to age-related changes. Physical functioning was assessed by an activities of daily living score and by physical performance tests (grip strength, chair stand, and gait speed).
Findings
The chance of surviving from birth to age 93 years was 28\% higher in the 1915 cohort than in the 1905 cohort (6·50\% vs 5·06\%), and the chance of reaching 95 years was 32\% higher in 1915 cohort (3·93\% vs 2·98\%). The 1915 cohort scored significantly better on the mini-mental state examination than did the 1905 cohort (22·8 [SD 5·6] vs 21·4 [6·0]; p{\textless}0·0001), with a substantially higher proportion of participants obtaining maximum scores (28–30 points; 277 [23\%] vs 235 [13\%]; p{\textless}0·0001). Similarly, the cognitive composite score was significantly better in the 1915 than in the 1905 cohort (0·49 [SD 3·6] vs 0·01 [SD 3·6]; p=0·0003). The cohorts did not differ consistently in the physical performance tests, but the 1915 cohort had significantly better activities of daily living scores than did the 1905 cohort (2·0 [SD 0·8] vs 1·8 [0·7]; p{\textless}0·0001).
Interpretation
Despite being 2 years older at assessment, the 1915 cohort scored significantly better than the 1905 cohort on both the cognitive tests and the activities of daily living score, which suggests that more people are living to older ages with better overall functioning.

	abstract = {Objectives
Limited evidence exists regarding the reasons for secular changes in cognitive functioning over historical time. Thus, we examined potential explanatory factors for changes in cognitive speed, a central dimension of cognitive functioning.
Methods
Population-based data of middle-aged and older adults from Germany (N = 5443) was used with baseline participants from 2002 to 2014, comparing the time periods 2002–2014.
Results
Cognitive speed improved in middle-aged adults (40–65) and older adults (66+). In both age groups, increases were partly explained by education, employment status, volunteering status, routine activities, and physical functioning. Changes in education were more important in explaining increases in older than in middle-aged adults, whereas changes in health were more important for explaining increases in middle-aged adults.
Conclusions
Cognitive speed increased in both age groups over historical time. Education, employment, volunteering, routine activities, and health were all important in explaining these changes, but their importance differed between age groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. We examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1,751,841 people registered with 314 medical practices in Scotland as of March, 2007. We analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders.
FINDINGS: 42·2\% (95\% CI 42·1-42·3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23·2\% (23·08-23·21) were multimorbid. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210,500 vs 194,996). Onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11·0\%, 95\% CI 10·9-11·2\% in most deprived area vs 5·9\%, 5·8\%-6·0\% in least deprived). The presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6·74, 95\% CI 6·59-6·90 for five or more disorders vs 1·95, 1·93-1·98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2·28, 2·21-2·32 vs 1·08, 1·05-1·11).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. A complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.

Complete health assessments are available for 2,583 community residents 65 and older in 1982, and complete follow-up date are available for 1,319 respondents in 1988. Multivariate regressions of self-assessed health on concurrent 1982 and 1988 objective health status and longitudinal analysis of residual values from these equations show that: (a) older survey respondents gave disproportionately positive health assessments, and (b) processes of aging, selective survivorship, and cohort differences all appear to play a role in creating this pattern.},

	abstract = {Urinary and fecal incontinence (UI, FI) are co-morbid conditions affecting over 50\% of nursing home residents. Both forms of incontinence are risk factors for elderly persons to be placed in the nursing home, and such institutionalization itself is a risk factor for developing incontinence. Management should focus on identifying and treating underlying causes, such as detrusor instability, urinary tract infections, diet- or medication-induced diarrhea, constipation and fecal impaction. Despite appropriate management, residents may remain incontinent because of dementia and health or restraint-related immobility. Nursing homes lack the staff and financial resources to provide residents with sufficiently frequent toileting assistance (including prompted voiding). Use of special undergarments and absorbent pads is the usual practice. The article reviews the results of studies that have documented how prompted voiding programs can significantly reduce UI and FI, particularly if the intervention includes dietary and exercise components. Recent systematic anorectal testing of nursing home residents with FI has documented impaired sphincter function (risk factor for FI), decreased rectal sensation and sphincter dyssynergia (risk factor for constipation and impaction). The data suggest that the use of laxatives and stool softeners for prophylaxis against constipation and impaction related to underlying dyssynergia may have produced sufficient fluidity in the stool to predispose the residents with impaired sphincter function to manifest FI. Documentation of non-invasive and efficacious interventions by RCT and the labor costs of implementing these measures can lead to changes in how nursing home care is provided and funded.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12877-022-02836-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults are more susceptible to respiratory tract infection than healthy working age adults. The increased susceptibility of older adults is thought to be interlinked with vitamin D status, nourishment, and immunological state in general. Data are scarce whether these parameters could serve as prognostic markers.
AIM: To study whether serum 25(OH)D, albumin, and LL-37 level could give prognostic value of long-term survival in the older adults with multimorbidity and acute respiratory infection.
METHODS: Consecutive episodes of hospital care of patients 65 years and older with respiratory symptoms were prospectively studied as a cohort. Standard clinical questionnaire was filled by the study physician. Laboratory markers included serum levels of 25(OH)D, albumin and LL-37, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and polymerase chain reaction diagnostics for 14 respiratory viruses. Pneumonia was confirmed by chest radiographs. Respiratory illness severity, death at ward, length of hospital stays, and 5-year survival were used as outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 289 older adult patients with mean age of 83 years were included in the study. Serum 25(OH)D deficiency ({\textless} 50 nmol/liter) was present in 59\% and hypoalbuminemia ({\textless} 3.5 g/dL) in 55\% of the study patients. Low serum albumin level was associated to one, two- and five-year mortality after hospital stay (all P {\textless} .05). In addition, it was associated with pneumonia, dyspnea, over 13-night long stay at ward and death at ward (all P {\textless} .05). No associations were seen between serum 25(OH)D and LL-37 levels and disease severity, short-term clinical outcome, or long-term survival. Associations between serum 25(OH)D, albumin, and LL-37 levels and respiratory virus presence were not seen.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin level on admission seems to give valuable information about the patients' general health and recovery potential in treating older adults with respiratory symptoms. Serum 25(OH)D and LL-37 had no associations with disease severity or long- and short-term prognosis among older adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Lower continuity of care has been associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes for persons with multiple chronic medical conditions. It is unclear, however, whether this relationship also exists within integrated systems that offer high levels of informational continuity through shared electronic health records.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 12,200 seniors with 3 or more chronic conditions within an integrated delivery system. Continuity of care was calculated using the Continuity of Care Index, which reflects visit concentration with individual clinicians. Using Cox proportional hazards regression permitting continuity to vary monthly until the outcome or censoring event, we separately assessed inpatient admissions and emergency department visits as a function of primary care continuity and specialty care continuity.
RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates (demographics; baseline, primary, and specialty care visits; baseline outcomes; and morbidity burden), greater primary care continuity and greater specialty care continuity were each associated with a lower risk of inpatient admission (respective hazard ratios (95\% CIs) = 0.97 (0.96, 0.99) and 0.95 (0.93, 0.98)) and a lower risk of emergency department visits (respective hazard ratios = 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 0.98 (0.96, 1.00)). For the subgroup with 3 or more primary care and 3 or more specialty care visits, specialty care continuity (but not primary care continuity) was independently associated with a decreased risk of inpatient admissions (hazard ratio = 0.94 (0.92, 0.97)), and primary care continuity (but not specialty care continuity) was associated with a decreased risk of emergency department visits (hazard ratio = 0.98 (0.96, 1.00)).
CONCLUSIONS: In an integrated delivery system with high informational continuity, greater continuity of care is independently associated with lower hospital utilization for seniors with multiple chronic medical conditions. Different subgroups of patients will benefit from continuity with primary and specialty care clinicians depending on their care needs.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
Older people with problematic alcohol use vary in psychosocial functioning, age of onset for problem drinking and use of other drugs. The study measured the differential risks of all‐cause, alcohol‐, polydrug‐ and psychiatric‐related repeated hospitalizations among older people with problematic alcohol use.

Design
A linked register‐based cohort study with discontinuous multiple‐failure (time‐to‐repeated‐event) data. Hospitalization and mortality were considered as failure.

Setting
Sweden, March 2003–November 2017, using data from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) register linked to National Inpatient Register and the Swedish cause of death register.

Participants
Participants aged 50 years and older (n = 1741; 28.2\% women), with one or more alcohol problem days in the 30 days before an ASI assessment.

Measurements
Five mutually exclusive latent classes of problematic alcohol use, identified with 11 ASI items, were the independent variables: ‘late onset with fewer consequences (LO:FC; reference group)’; ‘early onset/prevalent multi‐dimensional problems (EO:MD)’; ‘late onset with co‐occurring anxiety and depression (LO:AD)’; ‘early onset with co‐occurring psychiatric problems (EO:PP)’; and ‘early onset with major alcohol problem (EO:AP)’. Covariates included socio‐demographic characteristics, previous hospitalization and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Outcome measurements included recurrent hospitalization and/or mortality due to: (a) all‐cause, (b) alcohol‐related disorders and diseases (c) polydrug use and (d) other psychiatric disorders.

Findings
During the study period, more than 75\% were hospitalized at least once or died. 57.3\% were hospitalized with alcohol‐related, 8.5\% with polydrug use and 18.5\% with psychiatric‐related diagnoses. Compared with LO:FC, EO:PP had higher risk for all‐cause [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.27, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.59] and alcohol‐related (aHR = 1.34, 95\% CI = 1.02–1.75) hospitalizations. Adjusted risks for polydrug‐related hospitalization were 2.55, 95\% CI = 1.04–6.27 for EO:MD and 2.62, 95\% CI = 1.07–6.40 for EO:PP. Adjusted risk for psychiatric‐related hospitalization was higher for LO:AD (aHR = 1.78, 95\% CI = 1.16–2.73 and EO:PP (aHR = 2.03, 95\% CI = 1.22–3.38).

Conclusions
Older addiction service users in Sweden have varying risks of hospitalization due to alcohol use, polydrug use and psychiatric disorders. Older people with problematic alcohol use who have multiple needs and are assessed in social services may benefit from earlier interventions with an integrated focus on substance use and mental health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: intensive or very loose glycemic control may contribute to the risk of falls in diabetic patients. However, studies on diabetes mellitus and the risk of falls have yielded conflicting results. Our objective was to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus on the risk of falls in older adults by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: the PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies published until November 2015. Only prospective cohort studies reporting at least age-adjusted risk estimate of falls compared diabetic to non-diabetic individuals were selected. Diabetes mellitus was ascertained by a combination of medical history and laboratory tests or use of anti-diabetic drugs.
RESULTS: a total of six studies involving 14,685 participants were identified. The number of falls in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals was 423 of 1,692 (25.0\%) and 2,368 of 13,011 (18.2\%), respectively. Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of falls (risk ratio [RR] = 1.64; 95\% confidence intervals [CI] 1.27-2.11) in a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses showed that the risk of falls seemed more pronounced among both gender groups (RR = 1.81; 95\% CI 1.19-2.76) than among women (RR = 1.52; 95\% CI 1.04-2.21). Diabetes increased 94\% (RR = 1.94; 95\% CI 1.42-2.63) and 27\% (RR = 1.27; 95\% CI 1.06-1.52) risk of falls in insulin-treated and no-insulin-treated patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: this meta-analysis reveals that older adults with diabetes mellitus are associated with greater risk of falls, and this association is more pronounced in insulin-treated patients.},

Thus, acute hospitalization represents a particularly vulnerable phase of transient dependency on social support and health care. This study examines how social and regional inequality affect the decision for an institutionalization after acute hospital discharge in Switzerland. The current analysis uses routinely collected inpatient data from all Swiss acute hospitals that was linked on the individual level with Swiss census data. The study sample included 60,209 patients 75 years old and older living still at a private home and being hospitalized due to a chronic health condition in 199 hospitals between 2010 and 2016. Random intercept multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the impact of social and regional factors on the odds of a nursing home admission after hospital discharge. Results show that 7.8\% of all patients were admitted directly to a nursing home after hospital discharge. We found significant effects of education level (compulsory vs. tertiary education OR = 1.16 (95\% CI: 1.03-1.30), insurance class (compulsory vs. private insurance OR = 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.09-1.41), living alone vs. living with others (OR = 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.53-1.76) and language regions (French vs. German speaking part: OR = 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.37-0.80) on the odds of nursing home admission in a model adjusted for age, gender, nationality, health status, year of hospitalization and hospital-level variance. The language regions moderated the effect of education and insurance class but not of living alone. This study shows that acute hospital discharge in older age is a critical moment of transient dependency especially for socially disadvantaged patients. Social and health care should work coordinated together to avoid unnecessary institutionalizations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies on the association between urinary incontinence (UI) and falls have reported conflicting results. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate and clarify this association through a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies.
METHODS: We performed a literature search for relevant studies in databases including PubMed and EMBASE from inception up to December 13, 2020, using several search terms related to UI and falls. Based on the data reported in these studies, we calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) for falls and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 38 articles and a total of 230,129 participants. UI was significantly associated with falls (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 1.45-1.83). Subgroup analyses based on the age and sex of the participants revealed a significant association between UI and falls in older (≥65 years) participants (OR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.31-1.93), and in both men (OR, 1.88; 95\% CI, 1.57-2.25) and women (OR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.29-1.54). Subgroup analysis based on the definition of falls revealed a significant association between UI and falls (≥1 fall event) (OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.42-1.82) and recurrent falls (≥2 fall events) (OR, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.49-1.78). According to the UI type, a significant association between UI and falls was observed in patients with urgency UI (OR, 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.15-1.70) and those with stress UI (OR, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.15).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis, which was based on evidence from a review of the published literature, clearly demonstrated that UI is an important risk factor for falls in both general and older populations.},

	abstract = {Backgrounds
Aspiration pneumonia is a dominant form of community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia, and a leading cause of death among ageing populations. However, the risk factors for developing aspiration pneumonia in older adults have not been fully evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to determine the risk factors for aspiration pneumonia among the elderly.

Methodology and Principal Findings
We conducted an observational study using data from a nationwide survey of geriatric medical and nursing center in Japan. The study subjects included 9930 patients (median age: 86 years, women: 76\%) who were divided into two groups: those who had experienced an episode of aspiration pneumonia in the previous 3 months and those who had not. Data on demographics, clinical status, activities of daily living (ADL), and major illnesses were compared between subjects with and without aspiration pneumonia. Two hundred and fifty-nine subjects (2.6\% of the total sample) were in the aspiration pneumonia group. In the univariate analysis, older age was not found to be a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia, but the following were: sputum suctioning (odds ratio [OR] = 17.25, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 13.16–22.62, p {\textless} 0.001), daily oxygen therapy (OR = 8.29, 95\% CI: 4.39–15.65), feeding support dependency (OR = 8.10, 95\% CI: 6.27–10.48, p {\textless} 0.001), and urinary catheterization (OR = 4.08, 95\% CI: 2.81–5.91, p {\textless} 0.001). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the risk factors associated with aspiration pneumonia after propensity-adjustment (258 subjects each) were sputum suctioning (OR = 3.276, 95\% CI: 1.910–5.619), deterioration of swallowing function in the past 3 months (OR = 3.584, 95\% CI: 1.948–6.952), dehydration (OR = 8.019, 95\% CI: 2.720–23.643), and dementia (OR = 1.618, 95\% CI: 1.031–2.539).

Conclusion
The risk factors for aspiration pneumonia were sputum suctioning, deterioration of swallowing function, dehydration, and dementia. These results could help improve clinical management for preventing repetitive aspiration pneumonia.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To report the updated and revised British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) guideline on indications, safe insertion and subsequent care of suprapubic catheters (SPCs).
METHODS: The existing BAUS guideline on the insertion of SPCs was reviewed and has been updated in light of both activity and outcome data published since the original guideline was written. A systematic review of all new data from 2010 onwards was carried out. This updated guideline is largely evidence-based but, where evidence was lacking, is based on the consensus of expert opinion from members of the BAUS Section of Female, Neurological and Urodynamic Urology.
RESULTS: Suprapubic catheterization is widely used and generally considered a safe procedure. There is, however, a small risk of serious complications including bowel injury. The BAUS has produced an updated consensus statement on SPC use with the aim of minimizing risks and establishing best practice. Areas for future research and development are also highlighted. This review has been commissioned and approved by the BAUS and the Section of Female, Neurological and Urodynamic Urology.
CONCLUSIONS: While SPC insertion is generally regarded as a safe procedure, the risk of serious morbidity and death must always be considered and outlined to patients. These revised guidelines should assist in minimizing the morbidity associated with SPC usage.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate national trends in hospitalization from indwelling urinary catheters complications from 2001 to 2010.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Healthcare Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was analyzed for this study. We examine hospitalization rates, patient demographics, hospital stays, insurance provider, hospital type, geographic location, and septicemia rates of patients hospitalized for indwelling urinary catheter complications from 2001 to 2010.
RESULTS: Hospitalization from indwelling urinary catheters almost quadrupled from 11,742 in 2001 to 40,429 in 2010. The increases have been due to patients who are older and predominantly male compared to all hospitalization. The "national bill" increased from \$213 million to \$1.3 billion (a factor of 6) after adjusting for inflation. Most patients had urinary tract infections, 77 \% in 2001 and 87 \% in 2010. Septicemia in indwelling urinary catheter hospitalization patients has increased from 21 \% in 2001 to 40 \% in 2010. In 2010, secondary diseases associated with hospitalization due to indwelling urinary catheters included urinary tract infections (86.5 \%), adverse effects of medical care (61.9 \%), bacterial infection (48.6 \%), and septicemia (40.3 \%).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization due to indwelling urinary catheter complications has almost quadrupled from 11,742 in 2001 to 40,429 in 2010, and the majority of patients had urinary tract infections. Septicemia is of particular concern since rates have almost doubled (from 21 to 40 \% over the period) in these patients. The specific medical indication for urinary catheters used postoperatively should be scrutinized, and the duration of placement should be minimized to reduce future complication rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Readmission in older adults is typically complex with multiple contributing factors. We aim to examine how two prevalent and potentially modifiable geriatric conditions - depressive symptoms and malnutrition - relate to other geriatric syndromes and 30-day readmission in hospitalized older adults.
METHODS: Consecutive admissions of patients ≥ 65 years to a general medical department were recruited over 16 months. Patients were screened for depression, malnutrition, delirium, cognitive impairment, and frailty at admission. Medical records were reviewed for poor oral intake and functional decline during hospitalization. Unplanned readmission within 30-days of discharge was tracked through the hospital's electronic health records and follow-up telephone interviews. We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict the relationship of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with geriatric syndromes that constitute covariates of interest and 30-day readmission outcome. Multiple logistic regression was performed for the independent associations of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with 30-day readmission, adjusting for variables based on DAG-identified minimal adjustment set.
RESULTS: We recruited 1619 consecutive admissions, with mean age 76.4 (7.9) years and 51.3\% females. 30-day readmission occurred in 331 (22.0\%) of 1,507 patients with follow-up data. Depressive symptoms, malnutrition, higher comorbidity burden, hospitalization in the one-year preceding index admission, frailty, delirium, as well as functional decline and poor oral intake during the index admission, were more commonly observed among patients who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge (P {\textless} 0.05). Patients with active depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to be frail (OR = 1.62, 95\% CI 1.22-2.16), had poor oral intake (OR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.02-1.79) and functional decline during admission (OR = 1.58, 95\% CI 1.11-2.23). Malnutrition at admission was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.07-2.19), delirium (OR = 2.33, 95\% CI 1.60-3.39) cognitive impairment (OR = 1.88, 95\% CI 1.39-2.54) and poor oral intake during hospitalization (OR = 2.70, 95\% CI 2.01-3.64). In minimal adjustment set identified by DAG, depressive symptoms (OR = 1.38, 95\% CI 1.02-1.86) remained significantly associated with 30-day readmission. The association of malnutrition with 30-day readmission was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, ethnicity and depressive symptoms in the minimal adjustment set (OR = 1.40, 95\% CI 0.99-1.98).
CONCLUSION: The observed causal associations support screening and targeted interventions for depressive symptoms and malnutrition during admission and in the post-acute period.},

We aimed to examine the effect of geriatric conditions and multimorbidity on readmission risk among older adults aged 80 and over.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients aged 80 and older discharged from a geriatric ward at a tertiary hospital, with phone follow-up for 12 months. Demographics, multimorbidity, and geriatric conditions were assessed before hospital discharge. Logistic regression models were conducted to analyse risk factors for 30-day readmission.
RESULTS: Patients readmitted had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores, and were more likely to have falls, frailty, and longer hospital stay, compared to those without 30-day readmission. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher Charlson comorbidity index score was associated with readmission risk. Older patients with a fall history within 12 months had a near 4-fold increase in readmission risk. Severe frailty status before index admission was associated with a higher 30-day readmission risk. Functional status at discharge was not associated with readmission risk.
CONCLUSION: In addition to multimorbidity, history of falls and frailty were associated with higher hospital readmission risk in the oldest.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the extent to which fear of falling (FOF) is associated with the onset of functional disability over a 2-year period in older adults using self-reported and performance-based measures.
METHODS: In 2012, 1,601 participants (aged 65-74 years) were recruited from four sites: Kingston and Saint-Hyacinthe, Canada; Manizales, Colombia; and Natal, Brazil. They were re-assessed in 2014. We quantified FOF using the Fall Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I; range: 16-64). Functional disability measures were (i) self-reported incident mobility disability, defined as difficulty climbing a flight of stairs or walking 400 m and (ii) incident poor physical performance, defined as a score {\textless}9 on the Short Physical Performance Battery. In the Poisson regression analysis, we included only those participants without functional disability at baseline to calculate incident risk ratios in 2014.
RESULTS: 1,355 participants completed the 2014 assessment, of which 917 and 1,078 had no mobility disability and poor physical performance at baseline, respectively. In 2014, 131 (14.3\%), and 166 (15.4\%) participants reported incident mobility disability and poor physical performance, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic, and health covariates, a one-point increase in FES-I at baseline was significantly associated with a 4\% increase in the risk of reporting incident mobility disability (95\% CI: 1.02-1.05) and a 3\% increase in the risk of developing poor physical performance at follow up in the overall sample (95\%CI: 1.01-1.05).
CONCLUSIONS: FOF is associated with a higher risk of incident mobility disability and poor physical performance in a cohort of older adults. It is increasingly important to study FOF's effect on functional disability and to take necessary measures to prevent the transition to end-stage disability.},

To determine whether one or more of these visual measures, in association with measures of sensation, strength, reaction time, and balance, can accurately predict falls in this group.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 12 months duration.
SETTING: Falls and Balance Laboratory, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute.
PARTICIPANTS: 156 community-dwelling men and women age 63 to 90 (mean age 76.5, standard deviation = 5.1).
MEASUREMENTS: Screening tests of vision, sensation, strength, reaction time and balance, falls.
RESULTS: Of the 148 subjects available at follow-up, 64 (43.2\%) reported falling, with 32 (21.7\%) reporting multiple falls. Multiple fallers had decreased vision, as indicated by all visual tests, with impaired depth perception, contrast sensitivity, and low-contrast visual acuity being the strongest risk factors. Subjects with good vision in both eyes had the lowest rate of falls, whereas those with good vision in one eye and only moderate or poor vision in the other eye had elevated falling rates-equivalent to those with moderate or poor vision in both eyes. Discriminant analysis revealed that impaired depth perception, slow reaction time, and increased body sway on a compliant surface were significantly and independently associated with falls. These variables correctly classified 76\% of the cases, with similar sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate that impaired vision is an important and independent risk factor for falls. Adequate depth perception and distant-edge-contrast sensitivity, in particular, appear to be important for maintaining balance and detecting and avoiding hazards in the environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia has been indicated as a reliable marker of frailty and poor prognosis among the oldest individuals. We evaluated the relationship between sarcopenia and 2-year risk of falls in a population of persons aged 80 years or older.
METHODS: Data are from the baseline and follow-up evaluations of the Aging and Longevity Study in the Sirente Geographic Area (ilSIRENTE Study) (n=260). According to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), sarcopenia was diagnosed in presence of low muscle mass (mid-arm muscle circumference) plus either low muscle strength (hand grip) or low physical performance (4-m walking speed). The primary outcome measure was the incident falls during the follow-up period of 2 years. The relationship between sarcopenia and incident falls was estimated by deriving hazard ratios (HRs) from multiple logistic regression models considering the dependent variable of interest at least one fall during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: Sixty-six participants (25.4\%) were identified as affected by sarcopenia. Eighteen out of 66 (27.3\%) participants with sarcopenia and 19 out of 194 (9.8\%) without sarcopenia reported incident falls during the two-year follow-up of the study (p{\textless}0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, cognitive impairment, ADL impairment, sensory impairments, BMI, depression, physical activity, cholesterol, stroke, diabetes, number of medications, and C-reactive protein, participants with sarcopenia had a higher risk of incident falls compared with non sarcopenic subjects (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.23; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-8.29).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that sarcopenia - assessed using the EWGSOP algorithm - is highly prevalent among elderly persons without gender differences (25\%). Sarcopenic participants were over three times more likely to fall during a follow-up period of 2 years relative to non sarcopenic individuals, regardless of age, gender and other confounding factors.},

	doi = {10.1093/gerona/gln015},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to examine, first, whether hearing acuity predicts falls and whether the potential association is explained by postural balance and, second, to examine whether shared genetic or environmental effects underlie these associations.
METHODS: Hearing was measured using a clinical audiometer as a part of the Finnish Twin Study on Aging in 103 monozygotic and 114 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63-76 years. Postural balance was indicated as a center of pressure (COP) movement in semi-tandem stance, and participants filled in a fall-calendar daily for an average of 345 days after the baseline.
RESULTS: Mean hearing acuity (better ear hearing threshold level at 0.5-4 kHz) was 21 dB (standard deviation [SD] 12). Means of the COP velocity moment for the best to the poorest hearing quartiles increased linearly from 40.7 mm(2)/s (SD 24.4) to 52.8 mm(2)/s (SD 32.0) (p value for the trend = .003). Altogether 199 participants reported 437 falls. Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for falls, with the best hearing quartile as a reference, were 1.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-3.8) in the second, 4.1 (95\% CI = 1.1-15.6) in the third, and 3.4 (95\% CI = 1.0-11.4) in the poorest hearing quartiles. Adjustment for COP velocity moment decreased IRRs markedly. Twin analyses showed that the association between hearing acuity and postural balance was not explained by genetic factors in common for these traits.
CONCLUSION: People with poor hearing acuity have a higher risk for falls, which is partially explained by their poorer postural control. Auditory information about environment may be important for safe mobility.},

A formal cognitive assessment and history of acute onset of symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. In view of the complex multifactorial causes of delirium, multicomponent non-pharmacological risk factor approaches are the most effective strategy for prevention. No convincing evidence shows that pharmacological prevention or treatment is effective. Drug reduction for sedation and analgesia and non-pharmacological approaches are recommended. Delirium offers opportunities to elucidate brain pathophysiology--it serves both as a marker of brain vulnerability with decreased reserve and as a potential mechanism for permanent cognitive damage. As a potent indicator of patients' safety, delirium provides a target for system-wide process improvements. Public health priorities include improvements in coding, reimbursement from insurers, and research funding, and widespread education for clinicians and the public about the importance of delirium.},

METHOD: A prospective multicenter cohort study conducted between 2006 and 2008 in two tertiary university teaching hospitals and one regional teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Patients of 65 years and older, acutely admitted and hospitalized for at least 48 hours, were invited to participate. Eighteen geriatric conditions were assessed at hospital admission, and outcomes (mortality, functional decline) were assessed one year after admission.
RESULTS: 639 patients were included, with a mean age of 78 years. IADL impairment (83\%), polypharmacy (61\%), mobility difficulty (59\%), high levels of primary caregiver burden (53\%), and malnutrition (52\%) were most prevalent. Except for polypharmacy and cognitive impairment, the reporting rate of the geriatric conditions in discharge summaries was less than 50\%. One year after admission, 35\% had died and 33\% suffered from functional decline. A high Charlson comorbidity index score, presence of malnutrition, high fall risk, presence of delirium and premorbid IADL impairment were associated with mortality and overall poor outcome (mortality or functional decline). Obesity lowered the risk for mortality.
CONCLUSION: Geriatric conditions were highly prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes after admission. Early recognition of these conditions in acutely hospitalized older patients and improving the handover to the general practitioner could lead to better health outcomes and reduce the burden of hospital admission for older patients.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Disability among older persons is a complex and highly dynamic process, with high rates of recovery and frequent transitions between states of disability. The role of intervening illnesses and injuries (ie, events) on these transitions is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between intervening events and transitions among states of no disability, mild disability, severe disability, and death and to determine the association of physical frailty with these transitions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted in greater New Haven, Connecticut, from March 1998 to December 2008 of 754 community-living persons aged 70 years or older who were nondisabled at baseline in 4 essential activities of daily living: bathing, dressing, walking, and transferring. Telephone interviews were completed monthly for more than 10 years to assess disability and ascertain exposure to intervening events, which included illnesses and injuries leading to either hospitalization or restricted activity. Physical frailty (defined as gait speed {\textgreater}10 seconds on the rapid gait test) was assessed every 18 months through 108 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Transitions between no disability, mild disability, and severe disability and 3 transitions from each of these states to death, evaluated each month.
RESULTS: Hospitalization was strongly associated with 8 of the 9 possible transitions, with increased multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) as high as 168 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 118-239) for the transition from no disability to severe disability and decreased HRs as low as 0.41 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.54) for the transition from mild disability to no disability. Restricted activity also increased the likelihood of transitioning from no disability to both mild and severe disability (HR, 2.59; 95\% CI, 2.23-3.02; and HR, 8.03; 95\% CI, 5.28-12.21), respectively, and from mild disability to severe disability (HR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.84), but was not associated with recovery from mild or severe disability. For all 9 transitions, the presence of physical frailty accentuated the associations of the intervening events. For example, the absolute risk of transitioning from no disability to mild disability within 1 month after hospitalization for frail individuals was 34.9\% (95\% CI, 34.5\%-35.3\%) vs 4.9\% (95\% CI, 4.7\%-5.1\%) for nonfrail individuals. Among the possible reasons for hospitalization, fall-related injury conferred the highest likelihood of developing new or worsening disability.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older persons, particularly those who were physically frail, intervening illnesses and injuries greatly increased the likelihood of developing new or worsening disability. Only the most potent events, ie, those leading to hospitalization, reduced the likelihood of recovery from disability.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study.
SETTING: Geriatric and Internal Medicine acute care units.
PARTICIPANTS: Data are from 1,686 patients aged 65 and older who independent in BADL 2 weeks before hospital admission, enrolled in the 1998 survey of the Italian Group of Pharmacoepidemiology in the Elderly Study.
MEASUREMENTS: Study outcome was new BADL disability at time of hospital discharge. Sociodemographic, functional status, and clinical characteristics were collected at hospital admission; acute and chronic conditions were classified according to the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision; fasting blood samples were obtained and processed with standard methods.
RESULTS: At the time of hospital discharge 113 patients (6.7\%) presented new BADL disability. Functional decline was strongly related to patients' age and preadmission instrumental activities of daily living status. In a multivariate analysis, older age, nursing home residency, low body mass index, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute stroke, high level of comorbidity expressed as Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score, polypharmacotherapy, cognitive decline, and history of fall in the previous year were independent and significant predictors of BADL disability.
CONCLUSION: Several factors might contribute to loss of physical independence in hospitalized older persons. Preexisting conditions associated with the frailty syndrome, including physical and cognitive function, comorbidity, body composition, and inflammatory markers, characterize patients at high risk of functional decline.},

	abstract = {Clinical handover is one of the most critical steps in a patient’s journey and is a core skill that needs to be taught to health professional students and junior clinicians. Performed well, clinical handover should ensure that lapses in continuity of patient care, errors and harm are reduced in the hospital or community setting. Handover, however, is often poorly performed, with critical detail being omitted and irrelevant detail included. Evidence suggests that the use of a structured, standardised framework for handover, such as ISBAR, improves patient outcomes. The ISBAR (Introduction, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) framework, endorsed by the World Health Organisation, provides a standardised approach to communication which can be used in any situation. In the complex clinical environment of healthcare today, ISBAR is suited to a wide range of clinical contexts, and works best when all parties are trained in using the same framework. It is essential that healthcare leaders and professionals from across the health disciplines work together to ensure good clinical handover practices are developed and maintained. Organisations, including universities and hospitals, need to invest in the education and training of health professional students and health professionals to ensure good quality handover practice. Using ISBAR as a framework, the purpose of this paper is to highlight key elements of effective clinical handover, and to explore teaching techniques that aim to ensure the framework is embedded in practice effectively.},

DESIGN: Observational.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital, community teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Older (aged {\textgreater}or=70) patients nonelectively admitted to general medical services (1993-1998).
MEASUREMENTS: Number of ADL disabilities at preadmission baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Outcomes were death, sustained decline in ADL function, and recovery to baseline ADL function at each time point.
RESULTS: By 12 months after discharge, of those discharged with new or additional ADL disability, 41.3\% died, 28.6\% were alive but had not recovered to baseline function, and 30.1\% were at baseline function. Of those discharged at baseline function, 17.8\% died, 15.2\% were alive but with worse than baseline function, and 67\% were at their baseline function (P{\textless}.001). Of those discharged with new or additional ADL disability, the presence or absence of recovery by 1 month was associated with long-term outcomes. Age, cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer, low albumin, and greater number of dependencies in instrumental ADLs independently predicted failure to recover.
CONCLUSION: For older adults discharged with new or additional disability in ADL after hospitalization for medical illness, prognosis for functional recovery is poor. Rehabilitation interventions of longer duration and timing than current reimbursement allows, caregiver support, and palliative care should be evaluated.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the changes in activities of daily living (ADL) function occurring before and after hospital admission in older people hospitalized with medical illness and to assess the effect of age on loss of ADL function.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: The general medical service of two hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand two hundred ninety-three patients aged 70 and older (mean age 80, 64\% women, 24\% nonwhite).
MEASUREMENTS: At the time of hospital admission, patients or their surrogates were interviewed about their independence in five ADLs (bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, and toileting) 2 weeks before admission (baseline) and at admission. Subjects were interviewed about ADL function at discharge. Outcome measures included functional decline between baseline and discharge and functional changes between baseline and admission and between admission and discharge.
RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of patients declined in ADL function between baseline and discharge. This included the 23\% of patients who declined between baseline and admission and failed to recover to baseline function between admission and discharge and the 12\% of patients who did not decline between baseline and admission but declined between hospital admission and discharge. Twenty percent of patients declined between baseline and admission but recovered to baseline function between admission and discharge. The frequency of ADL decline between baseline and discharge varied markedly with age (23\%, 28\%, 38\%, 50\%, and 63\% in patients aged 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and {\textgreater} or =90, respectively, P {\textless}.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, age was not associated with ADL decline before hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) for patients aged {\textgreater} or =90 compared with patients aged 70-74 = 1.26, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88-1.82). In contrast, age was associated with the failure to recover ADL function during hospitalization in patients who declined before admission (OR for patients aged {\textgreater} or =90 compared with patients aged 70-74 = 2.09, 95\% CI = 1.20-3.65) and with new losses of ADL function during hospitalization in patients who did not decline before admission (OR for patients aged {\textgreater} or =90 compared with patients aged 70-74 = 3.43, 95\% CI = 1.92-6.12).
CONCLUSION: Many hospitalized older people are discharged with ADL function that is worse than their baseline function. The oldest patients are at particularly high risk of poor functional outcomes because they are less likely to recover ADL function lost before admission and more likely to develop new functional deficits during hospitalization},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to synthesize the literature on patterns of use of emergency services among older adults, risk factors associated with adverse health outcomes, and effectiveness of intervention strategies targeting this population.
METHODS: Relevant articles were identified by means of an English-language search of MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, Current Contents, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1985 to January 2001. This search was supplemented with literature from reference sections of the retrieved publications. A qualitative approach was used to synthesize the literature.
RESULTS: Compared with younger persons, older adults use emergency services at a higher rate, their visits have a greater level of urgency, they have longer stays in the emergency department, they are more likely to be admitted or to have repeat ED visits, and they experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes after discharge. The risk factors commonly associated with the negative outcomes are age, functional impairment, recent hospitalization or ED use, living alone, and lack of social support. Comprehensive geriatric screening and coordinated discharge planning initiatives designed to improve clinical outcomes in older emergency patients have provided inconclusive results.
CONCLUSION: Older ED patients have distinct patterns of service use and care needs. The current disease-oriented and episodic models of emergency care do not adequately respond to the complex care needs of frail older patients. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of screening and intervention strategies targeting at-risk older ED patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It has previously been reported that patients aged over 65 years account for 15\% of Accident and Emergency (A\&E) attendances. Despite this, there have been few studies looking at older people's use of A\&E. This study describes the A\&E attendance patterns of older people, defined as those aged 65 years and over, using data from an NHS region over a number of years. Their attendances are also compared with those of the rest of the population.
DATA AND METHODS: A\&E attendance data were collected for 14 Acute Trusts in the West Midlands for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002 via the West Midlands Accident and Emergency Surveillance Centre.
RESULTS: Patients aged 65 years and over accounted for 18\% of all attendances. Attendance rates were highest in those aged over 80 years. Older patients were significantly more likely to attend during the morning and early afternoon, during the winter months, arrive by ambulance and require admission to hospital. Older patients were significantly more likely to attend with non-injury, particularly cardiac-related conditions. Injuries accounted for 33.1\% of attendances in the over-65s compared with 59.9\% in the 0-64s.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first in England to look at the A\&E attendance patterns of all older people in an NHS region. It has demonstrated the continued high level use of A\&E by those aged over 65 years. This highlights the need for continued systemic monitoring of A\&E attendance patterns to enable planners to accommodate the impact of the increasingly ageing population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beers criteria and screening tool of older person's prescriptions (STOPP) criteria are widely used to assess potentially inappropriate drug use (PIDU).
OBJECTIVE: the aims of the present study are (i) to assess the prevalence of PIDU based on 2012 Beers criteria and STOPP criteria and (ii) to determine the impact of PIDU, as defined by these criteria, on health outcomes among older in-hospital patients.
DESIGN: prospective observational study.
SETTING AND SUBJECTS: a total of 871 in-hospital patients participating to the CRIteria to Assess Appropriate Medication Use among Elderly Complex Patients project.
METHODS: outcome measures were (i) adverse drug reactions (ADR); (ii) decline in functional status; (iii) combined outcome (ADR or declined in functional status).
RESULTS: the prevalence of PIDU was 58.4\% applying Beers criteria, 50.4\% applying STOPP criteria and 75.0\% combining both sets of criteria. PIDU defined based on STOPP criteria was significantly associated with ADR [odds ratio (OR) 2.36; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-5.06], and decline in physical function (OR: 2.00; 95\% CI: 1.10-3.64), while, despite a positive trend, no significant association was observed for Beers criteria or the combination of both criteria. The combined outcome was significantly associated with PIDU defined based on Beers (OR: 1.74; 95\% CI: 1.06-2.85), STOPP criteria (OR: 2.14; 95\% CI: 1.32-3.47) or both (OR 2.02; 95\% CI: 1.06-3.84).
CONCLUSIONS: PIDU is common in hospitalised older adults and the combination of Beers and STOPP criteria might lead to the identification of a larger number of cases of PIDU than the application of a single set of criteria. STOPP criteria significantly predict all in-hospital outcomes considered, while Beers criteria were significantly associated with the combined outcome only.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a bundled intervention can increase detection of delirium and facilitate safer use of high-risk medications.
DESIGN: Pre-post interventional trial.
SETTING: Large academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 70 and older (n = 19,949) admitted between May 1, 2008, September 30, 2011. Individuals aged 80 and older admitted after April 26, 2010, received the intervention, those aged 80 and older admitted before were primary controls, and those aged 70 to 79 were concurrent controls.
INTERVENTION: The intervention uses a checklist promoting delirium prevention, recognition and management, and modifies the computerized provider order entry system to provide care focused on elderly adults.
MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of orders for activating the rapid response team for altered mental status, frequency of orders for haloperidol in excess of 0.5 mg or intravenous (IV) morphine in excess of 2 mg, and discharge disposition.
RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention had a mean age of 86.1 ± 4.6; 58.2\% were female. The number of orders to activate the rapid response team for altered mental status increased in participants receiving the bundle and in controls (odds ratio (OR) for the difference of differences = 1.23 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68-2.24, P = .49)). Participants receiving the bundle were less likely to receive more than 0.5 mg of IV, intramuscular, or oral haloperidol (OR = 0.60, 95\% CI = 0.39-0.91, P = .02) and more than 2 mg of IV morphine (OR = 0.52, 95\% CI = 0.42-0.63, P {\textless} .001). Participants who received the bundle were more likely to be discharged home than to extended care facilities (OR = 1.18, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.35, P = .01).
CONCLUSION: An intervention focused on delirium prevention and recognition by bedside staff combined with computerized decision support facilitates safer prescribing of high-risk medications and possibly results in less need for extended care.},

This collaborative learning effort aims to redesign care delivery to provide optimal value to hospitalized patients. With input from members of this initiative, we prepared this report which reviews the literature related to teamwork in hospitals. Teamwork is critically important to provide safe and effective hospital care. Hospitals with high teamwork ratings experience higher patient satisfaction, higher nurse retention, and lower hospital costs. Elements of effective teamwork have been defined and provide a framework for assessment and improvement efforts in hospitals. Measurement of teamwork is essential to understand baseline performance, and to demonstrate the utility of resources invested to enhance it and the subsequent impact on patient care. Interventions designed to improve teamwork in hospitals include localization of physicians, daily goals of care forms and checklists, teamwork training, and interdisciplinary rounds. Though additional research is needed to evaluate the impact on patient outcomes, these interventions consistently result in improved teamwork knowledge, ratings of teamwork climate, and better understanding of patients' plans of care. The optimal approach is implementation of a combination of interventions, with adaptations to fit unique clinical settings and local culture.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age-period-cohort (APC) models are often used to decompose health trends into period- and cohort-based sources, but their use in epidemiology and population sciences remains contentious. Central to the contention are researchers' failures to 1) clearly state their analytic assumptions and/or 2) thoroughly evaluate model results. These failures often produce varying conclusions across APC studies and generate confusion about APC methods. Consequently, scholarly exchanges about APC methods usually result in strong disagreements that rarely offer practical advice to users or readers of APC methods.
METHODS: We use research guidelines to help practitioners of APC methods articulate their analytic assumptions and validate their results. To demonstrate the usefulness of the guidelines, we apply them to a 2015 American Journal of Epidemiology study about trends in black-white differences in U.S. heart disease mortality.
RESULTS: The application of the guidelines highlights two important findings. On the one hand, some APC methods produce inconsistent results that are highly sensitive to researcher manipulation. On the other hand, other APC methods estimate results that are robust to researcher manipulation and consistent across APC models.
CONCLUSIONS: The exercise shows the simplicity and effectiveness of the guidelines in resolving disagreements over APC results. The cautious use of APC models can generate results that are consistent across methods and robust to researcher manipulation. If followed, the guidelines can likely reduce the chance of publishing variable and conflicting results across APC studies.},

	abstract = {Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the leading avoidable cause of death worldwide. Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) increases the risk of CVD among non-smokers. Smoking cessation benefits all smokers, regardless of age or amount smoked. The excess risk of CVD is rapidly reversible, and stopping smoking after a myocardial infarction reduces an individual's risk of CVD mortality by 36\% over 2 years. Smoking cessation is a key component of primary and secondary CVD prevention strategies, but tobacco use often receives less attention from cardiologists than other risk factors, despite the availability of proven treatments that improve smoking cessation rates. Both psychosocial counselling and pharmacotherapy are effective methods to help smokers quit, but they are most effective when used together. The first-line medications licensed to aid smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline, are effective in and appropriate for patients with CVD. An evidence-based approach for physicians is to routinely ask all patients about smoking status and SHS exposure, advise all smokers to quit and all patients to adopt smoke-free policies for their home and car, and offer all smokers in the office or hospital brief counselling, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, and referral to local programmes where psychosocial support can be sustained in person or by telephone. Like other chronic diseases, tobacco use requires a long-term management strategy. It deserves to be managed as intensively as other CVD risk factors.},

METHODS: Data on 4,449 subjects between 75 and 84 years old were derived from CLESA ("Cross-national determinants of quality of life and health services for the elderly". A ratio score of depressive symptoms derived form the CESD and GDS scales was regressed on education, marital status, living arrangements, comorbidity and disability and all interactions of these factors with gender and country.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms is higher in women than in men in every country, except Sweden. Women are more likely to be exposed to socio-structural risks, and have poorer health and more disability than men in most of the countries. However, women are not more vulnerable to these risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that the female excess in depressive symptoms remains after taking into account the higher prevalence of socio-structural and health-related risk factors and that older women are not more vulnerable than older men to these known risk factors, suggesting the existence of additional pathways linked to gender and/or biological sex.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: US life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries and is now decreasing.
OBJECTIVE: To examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends.
EVIDENCE: Life expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined.
FINDINGS: Between 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100 000 to 348.2 deaths/100 000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3\%; Maine, 20.7\%; Vermont, 19.9\%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0\%; Ohio, 21.6\%; Indiana, 14.8\%; Kentucky, 14.7\%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33 307 excess US deaths, 32.8\% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: US life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, making it vital to understand the underlying causes.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in morbidity--measured as self-assessed health, number of symptoms, number of diseases and physical function--in three different cohorts of 70-year olds, with special regard to the impact of social factors.
METHODS: We used data from random samples of 70-year-old people born in 1901/02 (cohort 1), 1906/07 (cohort 2), and 1911/12 (cohort 3). In the three cohorts there were 973, 1036 and 619 participants, respectively. They had a medical examination and were interviewed regarding social background, social network, self-assessed health, need of care, and number of diseases.
RESULTS: There were fewer 70-year olds not feeling healthy in the two younger cohorts (OR = 0.68; CI = 0.56-0.83, and OR = 0.67; CI = 0.53-0.84 respectively) and fewer with many symptoms. There were also indications of better physical functioning in the younger cohorts. Women seemed to have gained more than men, while the institutionalized persons had a deterioration.
CONCLUSIONS: There are indications of good years being added, but not for the institutionalized persons.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to compare cardiovascular morbidity and risk factor profiles of two 70-year-old cohorts of Finns examined in 1991 and 2011 and to describe prevalence of statin use according to cardiovascular risk in the later cohort.
METHODS: 1920-born cohort of community-dwelling 70-year-old persons (n = 1032) participated in comprehensive health surveys, physical and laboratory examinations in the Turku Elderly Study (TUVA) during 1991-92. In 2011, identical examination pattern was performed, in a 1940-born cohort of 70-year-old persons (n = 956) from the same area. Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and risk factors in the two cohorts was compared. Further, each cohort was divided into three cardiovascular risk groups (high, moderate and low) based on their estimated risk. Prevalence of statin use was calculated among each risk group in the 1940 cohort.
RESULTS: coronary heart disease (25 versus 11\%) and peripheral artery disease (9 versus 2\%) were more common in the 1920 than 1940 cohort, respectively. Lipid profile was worse and blood pressure higher in the earlier cohort, whereas use of statins and antihypertensives was more common in the later cohort. Forty-two per cent of the 1920 cohort and 29\% of the 1940 cohort were estimated to have high cardiovascular risk. In the 1940 cohort, a total of 36\% used statins. Statin use was most common among high-risk persons.
CONCLUSIONS: seventy-year olds examined in 2011 had less CVD morbidity than their counterparts 20 years earlier, and their cardiovascular risk factors were better controlled which is reflected in higher use of preventive medications, such as statins and antihypertensives.},

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1032 non-institutionalized people aged 70 in the city of Turku, Southern Finland. The cohort population was recruited as part of a larger longitudinal aging study, the Turku Elderly Study. Fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c and triglycerides were measured, and the amount of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated at baseline. The cohort was followed for mortality for 12 years, and the causes of death were recorded and further classified into cardiovascular and other causes of death. The hazard ratios of dying for subjects in various cholesterol quartiles were computed by the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and pre-existing medical conditions.
RESULTS: Low levels of serum total cholesterol and HDL-c were associated with a greater risk of death over a follow-up of 12 years. After adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, the association between total cholesterol and survival changed. All-cause mortality seemed to be highest in the highest quartile of total cholesterol and nearly as high in the lowest quartile of total cholesterol, suggesting a U-shaped connection, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, cardiovascular mortality was significantly lowest in the lowest quartile of total cholesterol and significantly highest in the lowest quartile of HDL-c.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of serum total cholesterol and particularly low levels of HDL-c seem to be risk factors for cardiovascular mortality even in the elderly population.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies investigating associations between early life factors and adult health are often limited to studying exposures that can be reliably recalled in adulthood or obtained from existing medical records. There are few US studies with detailed data on the pre- and postnatal environment whose study populations are now in adulthood; one exception is the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). We contacted former female participants of the New York site of the CPP who were born from 1959 to 1963 and were prospectively followed for 7 years to examine whether the pre- and postnatal environment is associated with adult health in women 40 years after birth. The New York CPP cohort is particularly diverse; at enrolment, the race/ethnicity distribution of mothers was approximately 30\% White, 40\% Black and 30\% Puerto Rican. Of the 841 eligible women, we successfully traced 375 women (45\%) and enrolled 262 women (70\% of those traced). Baseline data were available for all eligible women, and we compared those who participated with the remaining cohort (n = 579). Higher family socio-economic status at age 7, availability of maternal social security number, and White race/ethnicity were statistically significantly associated with a higher probability of tracing. Of those traced, race/ethnicity was associated with participation, with Blacks and Puerto Ricans less likely to participate than Whites (OR = 0.5, 95\% CI 0.3, 0.8, and OR = 0.5, 95\% CI 0.3, 1.0, respectively). In addition, higher weight at 7 years was associated with lower participation (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI 0.92, 0.99), but this association was observed only among the non-White participants. None of the other maternal characteristics, infant or early childhood growth measures was associated with participation or with tracing, either overall or within each racial/ethnic subgroup. Daughters' recall of early life factors such as pre-eclampsia (sensitivity = 24\%) and birthweight were generally poor, with the latter varying by category of birthweight with the highest sensitivity for the largest babies (81\%) and the lowest sensitivity for the smallest babies (54\%). These data reinforce the need to rejuvenate existing birth cohorts with prospective data for life course studies of adult health. Understanding the factors that are associated with tracing and participation in these existing cohorts will help in interpreting the validity and generalisability of the findings from these invaluable cohorts.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional mailed survey of three birth cohorts in 1989 and 1999.
PARTICIPANTS: Random samples of older home-dwelling residents from birth cohorts 1904, 1909, and 1914 in 1989 ( N = 685) and the birth cohorts 1914, 1919, and 1924 in 1999 ( N = 2,047) were asked the same questions.
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported physical functioning, need for assistance in daily living, and attitudes toward life.
RESULTS: Among 85-year-olds born in 1914 there was a significantly larger proportion able to go outdoors compared with 85-year-olds born in 1904 (72.9\% vs 60.6\% in women (P {\textless}.01) and 84.6\% vs 63.6 \% in men (P {\textless}.01), respectively). Similar trends were observed between the oldest cohorts concerning the need for assistance. The amount of publicly funded domestic help had reduced in the two oldest cohorts in 1999 compared with 1989 (20.3\% vs 29.8\% in 85-year-old women born in 1914 vs 1904 (P {\textless}.05); and 10.2 \% vs 25.0\% in 85-year-old men born 1914 vs 1904 (P {\textless}.05), but at the same time 75-year-old women born in 1924 had increased the use of private domestic help compared with 75-year-old women born in 1914. Significantly larger proportions of both men and women had plans for the future in all the cohorts in 1999 than in 1989.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent yet small differences between the corresponding cohorts suggest that physical functioning and more-optimistic attitude toward life have increased and need for assistance has decreased over 10 years in the older population up to the age of 85.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants (born 1904, 1909, and 1914) underwent detailed assessments with follow-up at 5 and at 10 years. Positive life orientation was determined as answering "yes" to all the following items: being satisfied with life, having zest for life, having plans for the future, feeling needed, seldom feeling lonely or depressed.
RESULTS: Of participants, 102 (20.8\%) had a positive life orientation. After 10 years, 54.5\% of them were alive, whereas in the rest of the sample 39.5\% survived (P=.004). After controlling for age, gender, and health measures, the impact of positive life orientation was still significant (HR=0.89, 95\% CI 0.83-0.93). At 5 years, only 2.9\% of those having a positive life orientation but 17.5\% of the rest of the sample were in permanent institutional care (P=0.003), with a positive life orientation remaining a significant protector against institutional care (OR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.36-0.93).

Meta-analysis was used to synthesize findings from 300 empirical studies on gender differences in life satisfaction, happiness, self-esteem, loneliness, subjective health, and subjective age in late adulthood. Older women reported significantly lower SWB and less positive self-concept than men on all measures, except subjective age, although gender accounted for less than 1\% of the variance in well-being and self-concept. Smaller gender differences in SWB were found in younger than in older groups. Statistically controlling for gender differences in widowhood, health, and socioeconomic status decreased gender differences in SWB. Cohort differences in SWB are reported as well.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between depression and mortality in older community-dwelling populations is still unresolved. This study determined the effect of both minor and major depression on mortality and examined the role of confounding and explanatory variables on this relationship.
METHODS: A cohort of 3056 men and women from the Netherlands aged 55 to 85 years were followed up for 4 years. Major depression was defined according to DSM-III criteria by means of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Minor depression was defined as clinically relevant depression (defined by a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score {\textgreater} or = 16) not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for major depression.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding variables (sociodemographics, health status), men with minor depression had a 1.80-fold higher risk of death (95\% confidence interval, 1.35-2.39) during follow-up than nondepressed men. In women, minor depression did not significantly increase the mortality risk. Irrespective of sex, major depression was associated with a 1.83-fold higher mortality risk (95\% confidence interval, 1.09-3.10) after adjustment for sociodemographics and health status. Health behaviors such as smoking and physical inactivity explained only a small part of the excess mortality risk associated with depression.
CONCLUSION: Even after adjustment for sociodemographics, health status, and health behaviors, minor depression in older men and major depression in both older men and women increase the risk of dying.},

In the current investigation, over 400 participants were followed over a 48-month period during which SWB and predictor measures were taken at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the study. Predictors of SWB included demographic variables, domain satisfactions and stresses, current hassles and uplifts, and personality characteristics and styles. Component measures of SWB included both long- and short-term affect measures. As expected, long-term components of SWB yielded average temporal stability coefficients of 0.60 while short-term components averaged coefficients of only 0.35. With the exception of demographic variables, that fail to achieve significant predictive power and daily hassles, that have small predictive power, only personalty factors and domain satisfactions, averaged over all domains, reached the stability of long-term SWB components. When structural equation modelling was employed with significant SWB predictors, including prior SWB scores, top-down and bi-directional models provided the best fit for the data. These results are more consistent with our earlier hypothesis that SWB has both trait- and state-like properties than with one that attributes SWB stability solely to environmental and personality variables.},

	abstract = {Numerous epidemiological reports have found that adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult girls and women are more likely to be diagnosed with unipolar depression and report greater symptoms of depression when compared to boys and men of similar ages. What is less well-known is whether this gender difference persists into late life. This literature review examines whether the well-known gender difference in unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to the gender difference in unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to the gender difference in the elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to the gender difference in the elderly. In this review of 85 empirical studies from every continent except for Antarctica, we find substantial support for the gender difference in depression in individuals who are 60 and older. More research is necessary to determine which factors are the strongest predictors of the gender difference in depression in late life, and particularly whether the factors that seem to be responsible for the gender difference in depression in earlier life stages continue to predict the gender difference in the elderly, and/or whether new factors come into play in late life. Longitudinal research, meta-analyses, and model-based investigations of predictors of the gender difference in depression are needed to provide insights into how and why the gender difference in depression persists in older age.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Old age is accompanied by a higher risk of losing a spouse. This study aims to longitudinally investigate the effect of widowhood on depression severity with a special focus on sex differences. We examine depression before and after widowhood in men and women separately to investigate which sex is at greater risk after losing a spouse.
METHODS: Data came from the AgeDifferent.de platform, which includes three pooled old age cohort studies. In order to examine factors associated with depression over time, we applied a linear hybrid mixed-effects regression model for the overall sample and analysed additional separate models for men and women.
RESULTS: Of 2470 respondents (mean age at baseline 79.2 (SD 3.64) years), 1256 were men. In total, 209 men and 332 women experienced spousal bereavement after baseline. In general, both sexes showed higher depression severity after widowhood. However, there were significant sex differences. Widowed men were more prone to subsequent depression than widowed women. In terms of depression severity, widowed men differed significantly compared to non-widowed men; however, this was not the case for women.
LIMITATION: We harmonized three cohort studies which used different measurement scales for depression and different recruitment procedures.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that although both genders suffer from losing a spouse, men are more prone to subsequently develop depressive symptoms. Raising the awareness among practitioners for sex-specific differences as well as developing tailored interventions for both widowed men and women should be considered.},

	abstract = {As pertains to life orientation, the study's conceptual framework demonstrates the importance of close relationships, meaning in life, and the strength of individuals to look forward and make plans for future. The aim of this study is to discover, in relation to background factors such as language, living situation, and culture, how people aged 65 and 75 experience life orientation. The study is a population-based cross-sectional survey with its material taken from 3,370 questionnaires which included the six-question Life Orientation scale. The SPSS static program, version 14.0, was used for all calcuations and the Chi-squared test was applied to determine if any significant differences between the groups existed. As seen in this study, most respondents aged 65 (85\%) and 75 (73.2\%) experienced a high degree of positive life orientation, clearly expressing a zest for life (93.5\%), overall satisfaction with their lives (88.4\%), and feelings of being needed (83.7\%). Lower scores were given for never/seldom being depressed/sad (55.3\%) and never/seldom feeling lonely (71.8\%). Approximately every second respondent (51.9\%) had plans for the future. A clear decreasing trend was seen in all questions for respondents aged 75 in comparison to those aged 65: only ;;are you satisfied with life?'' showed no significant differences. Language/culture seems to clearly affect experiences of life orientation and well-being. Additionally, older people living alone reported significantly more negative response to all dimensions of life orientation. Positive life orientation is an important inner health resource for older. Accordingly, health promotion for older people should focus on facilitating the maintenance of important and close relationships and should include supporting older people's need to be needed.},

AIM: To investigate how self-reported PLO changed among home-dwelling people from age 70 to 80 and 85 years.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, population-based 15-year follow-up study of the age cohort of 70-year-olds living in the city of Turku, Finland.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The data were collected in 1991 by a postal questionnaire that was sent to all residents of Turku, Finland, born in 1920 (N=1530). Follow-ups using the same procedure were conducted in 2001 and 2006. PLO was assessed with the following items: life satisfaction, feeling needed, having plans for the future, having zest for life, feeling depressed, and suffering from loneliness. We created a PLO score from the answers to these questions, where 1 represented the best PLO and 0 the poorest.
RESULTS: At baseline, the participants showed rather high levels of positive life orientation (PLO total score 0.83). PLO declined markedly after the 70-year-old participants reached the age of 80 and 85 years (p{\textless}.001). However, depressive feelings remained quite stable. The decrease was similar among men and women except for the items suffering from loneliness and feeling needed. At age 70 and 80 years women suffered more from loneliness than men, while men experienced feeling needed more than women.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive life orientation declines during old age, especially from age 70 to 80 years. Thereafter the decline is less steep except for changes in future plans and feeling needed.},

AIM: The aim of this study was to identify factors connected with positive life orientation among home-dwelling older people.
STUDY DESIGN: An explorative, population-based cross-sectional study of the age cohort of 70-year-olds living at home at the age of 70, 80, 85 and 90.
METHODS: The data were collected in 1991 among all residents of Turku, Finland, born in 1920 (N = 1530). Follow-ups were conducted in 2001 (n = 656), 2006 (n = 304) and 2011 (n = 156). A multiple regression analysis was conducted to estimate a model of factors that connected with PLO.
RESULTS: Several factors were significantly connected with PLO at ages 70, 80, 85 and 90. For example, if 70-year-old respondents perceived themselves as being in better health than others of the same age, it improved their PLO. We also observed that PLO was improved by good self-rated health during the past 12 months at 80, good self-rated health at 85 and good self-rated health compared to others of the same age at 90. The various explanatory models explained between 24 and 36\% of the variance in outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results showed that the respondents' own subjective views were significant independent factors of PLO in all four analyses (70, 80, 85 and 90 years). These subjective experiences remained significant even when objective indicators such as medication use, the presence of diseases and functional capacity were taken into account.},

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: The general medical service of two hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand two hundred ninety-three patients aged 70 and older (mean age 80, 64\% women, 24\% nonwhite). MEASUREMENTS: At the time of hospital admission, patients or their surrogates were interviewed about their independence in five ADLs (bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, and toileting) 2 weeks before admission (baseline) and at admission. Subjects were interviewed about ADL function at discharge. Outcome measures included functional decline between baseline and discharge and functional changes between baseline and admission and between admission and discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of patients declined in ADL function between baseline and discharge. This included the 23\% of patients who declined between baseline and admission and failed to recover to baseline function between admission and discharge and the 12\% of patients who did not decline between baseline and admission but declined between hospital admission and discharge. Twenty percent of patients declined between baseline and admission but recovered to baseline function between admission and discharge. The frequency of ADL decline between baseline and discharge varied markedly with age (23\%, 28\%, 38\%, 50\%, and 63\% in patients aged 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, and ≥90, respectively, P {\textless} .001). After adjustment for potential confounders, age was not associated with ADL decline before hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) for patients aged ≥90 compared with patients aged 70–74 = 1.26, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88–1.82). In contrast, age was associated with the failure to recover ADL function during hospitalization in patients who declined before admission (OR for patients aged ≥90 compared with patients aged 70–74 = 2.09, 95\% CI = 1.20–3.65) and with new losses of ADL function during hospitalization in patients who did not decline before admission (OR for patients aged ≥90 compared with patients aged 70–74 = 3.43, 95\% CI = 1.92–6.12). CONCLUSION: Many hospitalized older people are discharged with ADL function that is worse than their baseline function. The oldest patients are at particularly high risk of poor functional outcomes because they are less likely to recover ADL function lost before admission and more likely to develop new functional deficits during hospitalization},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inactivity during hospitalization in older medical patients may lead to functional decline. This study quantified 24-hour mobility, validated the accelerometers used, and assessed the daily level of basic mobility in acutely admitted older medical patients during their hospitalization.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study in older medical patients able to walk independently (ambulatory patients) and those not able to walk independently (nonambulatory patients) on admission. The 24-hour mobility level during hospitalization was assessed by measuring the time in lying, sitting, and standing and/or walking, by two accelerometers. Basic mobility was quantified within 48 hours of admission and repeated daily throughout hospitalization.
RESULTS: Forty-three ambulatory patients and six nonambulatory patients were included. The ambulatory patients tended to be hospitalized for fewer days than the nonambulatory patients (7 vs 16, p = .13). The ambulatory patients were lying median 17 hours, (interquartile range [IQR]: 14.4-19.1), sitting 5.1 hours (IQR: 2.9-7.1), and standing and/or walking 1.1 hours (IQR: 0.6-1.7) per day. On days with independency in basic mobility, the ambulatory patients were lying 4.1 hours less compared with days with dependency in basic mobility (p {\textless} .0001), sitting 2.4 hours more (p = .0004), and standing 0.9 hours more (p {\textless} .0001). The algorithm identification for lying, sitting, and standing and/or walking of the accelerometers, corresponded by 89\%-100\% with positions performed by older medical patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Older acutely hospitalized medical patients with walking ability spent 17h/d of their in-hospital time in bed, and the level of in-hospital mobility seemed to depend on the patients' level of basic mobility. The accelerometers were valid in assessing mobility in older medical patients.},

DESIGN: A prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: One hundred fifty–bed Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five hospitalized medical patients, aged 65 and older who were not delirious, did not have dementia, and were able to walk in the 2 weeks before admission were eligible. MEASUREMENTS: Wireless accelerometers were attached to the thigh and ankle of patients for the first 7 days after admission or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. The mean proportion of time spent lying, sitting, and standing or walking was determined for each hour after hospital admission using a previously validated algorithm. RESULTS: Forty-five male patients (mean age 74.2) with a mean length of stay of 5.1 days generated 2,592 one-hour periods of data. A baseline functional assessment indicated that 35 (77.8\%) study patients were willing and able to walk a short distance independently. No patient remained in bed the entire measured hospital stay, but on average, 83\% of the measured hospital stay was spent lying in bed. The average amount of time that any one individual spent standing or walking ranged from a low of 0.2\% to a high of 21\%, with a median of 3\%, or 43 minutes per day.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia is generally used to describe the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of physical frailty and functional impairment that may occur with old age. The knowledge surrounding the prevalence and determinants of sarcopenia in older medical patients is scarce, and it is unknown whether specific biomarkers can predict physical deconditioning during hospitalisation. We hypothesise that a combination of clinical, functional and circulating biomarkers can serve as a risk stratification tool and can (i) identify older acutely ill medical patients at risk of prolonged hospital stays and (ii) predict changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and function during hospitalisation.
METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The Copenhagen PROTECT study is a prospective cohort study consisting of acutely ill older medical patients admitted to the acute medical ward at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. Assessments are performed within 24 hours of admission and include blood samples, body composition, muscle strength, physical function and questionnaires. A subgroup of patients transferred to the Geriatric Department are included in a smaller geriatric cohort and have additional assessments at discharge to evaluate the relative change in circulating biomarker concentrations, body composition, muscle strength and physical function during hospitalisation. Enrolment commenced 4 November 2019, and proceeds until August 2021.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the local ethics committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg (H-19039214) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (P-2019-239) and all experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Findings from the project, regardless of the outcome, will be published in relevant peer-reviewed scientific journals in online (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Compare risk-adjusted length of stay (LOS) in VA and other United States (non-VA) hospitals and determine if relative differences in LOS have changed in recent years.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PATIENTS: Patients with ten common medical diagnoses admitted to all VA hospitals and to non-VA hospitals included in the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) during 1996 through 1999.
DATA: Comparable data elements were obtained from VA administrative databases and the NHDS. LOS was adjusted for age, gender, marital status, and comorbidity. Comorbidity was assessed using a validated methodology that considers 30 conditions.
RESULTS: Unadjusted mean LOS was longer in VA than non-VA patient for all 4 years, in aggregate (7.1 vs. 4.9 days, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001), and for each year individually. However, the difference in mean LOS in VA and non-VA patients declined from 2.9 days in 1996 to 1.6 days in 1999. LOS in VA patients remained longer (P {\textless} 0.001) in linear regression analyses, adjusting for demographics and comorbidity. However, the difference in LOS declined from 28.5\% (95\% CI, 28.1\%-29.0\%) in 1996 to 17.0\% (95\% CI, 16.6\%-17.4\%) in 1999. These results were similar in analyses of individual geographic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adjusted LOS was longer in VA hospitals than in other United States hospitals. However, differences in LOS narrowed between 1996 and 1999. These findings suggest that changes in the organization and delivery of VA health care in the mid-1990s may be closing the gap between the VA and other healthcare systems in hospital utilization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Length of hospital stay continues to decline, but the effect on postdischarge outcomes is unclear.
METHODS: We determined trends in risk-adjusted mortality rates and readmission rates for 83,445 Medicare patients discharged alive after hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or stroke. Patients were stratified into deciles of observed/expected length of stay to determine whether patients whose length of stay was much shorter than expected had higher risk-adjusted mortality and readmission rates. Analyses were stratified by whether a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order was written within 2 days of admission (early) or later.
RESULTS: From 1991 through 1997, risk-adjusted postdischarge mortality generally remained stable for patients without a DNR order. Postdischarge mortality increased by 21\% to 72\% for patients with early DNR orders and increased for 2 of 6 diagnoses for patients with late DNR orders. Markedly shorter than expected length of stay was associated with higher than expected risk-adjusted mortality for patients with early DNR orders but not for others (no DNR and late DNR). Risk-adjusted readmission rates remained stable from 1991 through 1997, except for a 15\% (95\% confidence interval, 3\%-30\%) increase for patients with congestive heart failure. Short observed/expected length of stay was not associated with higher readmission rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic decline in length of stay from 1991 through 1997 was not associated with worse postdischarge outcomes for patients without DNR orders. However, postdischarge mortality increased among patients with early DNR orders, and some of this trend may be due to patients being discharged more rapidly than previously.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine risk factors for prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) in the oldest-old inpatients aged ≥ 90.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed in acute Geriatrics Department at Kaplan Medical Center. The target population was the oldest-old inpatients aged ≥ 90 hospitalized with acute illness. In total 1536 admissions of 987 patients admitted between January 2007 and December 2010 from the emergency room were included in the study. We retrieved from the electronic hospital records the following data: demographics, admission diagnosis, comorbidities, laboratory tests, drugs, functional and cognitive status, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score and age-adjusted CCI score.
RESULTS: The risk factors for a prolonged LOS were tube-feeding, consumption of ≥ 5 drugs, non-independent functional status, diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia and malignancy on admission, and comorbidities of congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypoalbuminemia. Multiple linear regression analysis found that UTI, hypoalbuminemia, elevated troponin, pneumonia, number of drugs, malignancy, CHF and number of comorbidities explain a higher risk for a longer LOS.
CONCLUSION: Hospital LOS in the oldest-old patients in acute geriatric ward was associated with admission diagnosis and comorbidities. Awareness of the risk factors for a longer LOS might contribute to reducing hospitalization stay and its related negative consequences. Accurate prediction of prolonged LOS in this age group of patients may be more challenging and require variables that were not included in our study. Future research is warranted.},

This large-scale clinical study aimed to identify effective risk factors that predict mortality in the elderly population with a particular focus on age and hospitalization status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed outcomes from patients with clinical follow-up between July 2015 and January 2020 at 29 Mayıs State Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. Patient records with missing or ambiguous data were excluded. Age, sex, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, consultation requests and diagnoses that include infectious diseases were evaluated for their role in predicting in-hospital mortality using binary logistic regression analysis. Primary outcomes focused on factors that had an impact on overall in-hospital mortality in the elderly population.
RESULTS: Our study included 11,430 patients; of this group, 39.9\% were elderly, which we defined as 65 years of age or older. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in this cohort included consultation requests (AOR = 1.95, CI (1.53–2.49), P {\textless} 0.001) and length of hospital stay of ≥4 days (AOR = 2.49, CI (1.90–3.26), P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients are at significantly higher risk for in-hospital mortality than are younger patients. Among the factors that may be used to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in the elderly patient cohort, the most important factor is the length of hospital stay.},

In response to this need, geriatric emergency medicine (GEM) has developed into a robust area of academic and clinical interest, with extensive evidence-based research and guidelines, including clear undergraduate and postgraduate GEM competencies. Despite these developments, GEM content remains underrepresented in curricula and licensing examinations. The complex reasons for these deficits include a perception that care of older adults is not a core emergency medicine (EM) competency, a disjunction between traditional definitions of expertise and the GEM perspective, and lack of curricular capacity. This White Paper, prepared on behalf of the Academy of Geriatric Emergency Medicine, describes the state of GEM education, identifies the challenges it faces, and reviews innovations, including research presented at the 2018 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Annual Scientific Meeting. The authors propose a number of recommendations. These include recognizing GEM as a core educational priority in EM, enhancing academic support for GEM clinician-educators, using social learning and practical problem solving to teach GEM concepts, emphasizing a whole-person multisystem approach to care of older adults, and identifying ageist attitudes as a hurdle to safe and effective GEM care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine loneliness among two birth cohorts, born 20 years apart, when they were 70 years of age, and to identify factors explaining loneliness.
METHODS: The cohorts consisted of older home-dwelling residents of Turku, Finland, from the birth cohort 1920 in 1991 (N=1530) and the birth cohort 1940 in 2011 (N=1307). Suffering from loneliness was assessed with the question: 'Do you suffer from loneliness?' Cross-tabulations with chi-square test, general linear model (GLM) and multiple regression analysis were used in statistical testing and modeling.
RESULTS: In the 1940 cohort, around one-fifth (18\%) of the respondents suffered from loneliness at least sometimes, while the corresponding figure in the 1920 cohort was around one-fourth (26\%). Our analyses indicated that the effect of cohort was not a statistically significant explanatory factor of loneliness. Living status, self-rated health and memory compared to age peers were statistically significant explanatory factors for suffering from loneliness. When we controlled the effect of depressiveness on the experience of loneliness, it was shown that the effects of living status and self-rated health remained statistically significant, whereas memory compared to age peers did not. Depressiveness itself was highly important. The combined effect of living status and self-rated health emerged as the most significant explanatory factor for loneliness. Older people with poor self-rated health who lived alone were most likely to suffer from loneliness.
CONCLUSION: The findings give healthcare professionals an opportunity to plan for interventions aimed at combating loneliness among home-dwelling older people.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The goal of this study was to analyze potential associations between referrals to hospitals and various factors, including patient age and sex, and several diagnoses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross sectional study included 2,050,453 adult patients (mean age (SD): 52.3 (19.8) years; 53.0\% women) with at least one visit to 1 of 900 general practices (GPs) in Germany between January 2019 and December 2019 documented in the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). The main outcome of the study was the prevalence of patients with at least 1 referral to hospital in 2019. A multivariate logistic regression model was conducted to study the association between age, sex, the predefined diagnoses, and referrals to hospitals.
RESULTS: Of the patients analyzed, 6.6\% were referred to hospitals in 2019. The proportion of patients who were referred to hospitals increased with age, from 3.5\% in the 18 - 40 age group to 12.5\% in the age group over 80. In the multivariate regression analyses, 23 diseases were significantly associated with referrals to hospitals. The strongest association was observed for acute appendicitis (odds ratio (OR: 15.64 (95\% confidence intervals (CI): 14.70 - 16.64)), followed by hernia (OR: 4.36 (95\% CI: 4.21 - 4.51)), cholelithiasis (OR: 3.08 (05\% CI: 2.95 - 3.22)), breathing abnormalities (OR: 2.58 (95\% CI: 2.49 - 2.69)), cancer (OR: 2.32 (95\% CI: 2.26 - 2.37)), and abdominal and pelvic pain (OR: 2.28 (95\% CI: 2.23 - 2.34)).
CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients referred to hospitals is high, and hospital care plays an important role in treating several gastrointestinal, oncological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders.},

Heart failure will continue to be a central public health issue in the future as the population ages. This article focuses on regional differences, the costs of the disease, and the expected rate of increase in cases in the near future.
METHODS: This analysis is based on diagnosis statistics, cause-of-death statistics, and cost of illness data, as reported by the German Federal Statistical Office. Age- and sex-specific differences are taken into account.
RESULTS: 2006 was the first year in which heart failure led to more hospital admissions in Germany (317 000) than any other diagnosis. At present, about 141 000 persons in Germany aged 80 and over have heart failure; by the year 2050, it is predicted that more than 350 000 persons in this age group will be affected. The rate of diagnosis of heart failure, its frequency as a cause of death, and the costs associated with it all vary across the individual states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The nationwide cost of heart failure in 2006 was estimated at 2.9 billion euros.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that heart failure has become more common as an admission diagnosis of hospitalized patients in Germany. Because the population is aging, new concepts for prevention and treatment will be needed in the near future so that the affected patients can continue to receive adequate care.},

Resource constrains have increased the importance of understanding rising emergency admissions, which in policy discourse is often explained by population aging. This study examines how far the rise in emergency admissions of people over 65 was due to population ageing, how far to the changing likelihood of entering hospital at each age, and how far to other factors which might be more amenable to policy measures. It shows that: admission rates rose with age from age 40 upward but each successive birth cohort experienced lower emergency admission rates after standardising for age and other effects. This downward cohort effect largely offset the consequences of an older and larger population aged over 65. Other factors which could explain increasing admissions, such as new technologies or rising expectations, appear more important than the changing size and age structure of the population as drivers of rising emergency admissions in old age. These findings suggest that stemming the rate of increase in emergency admissions of older people may be feasible, if challenging, despite population ageing.},

Using data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), in this paper we perform, for all patients treated in English hospitals between 1997/8 and 2014/15, an age, period, cohort (APC) analysis to examine how far trends in emergency and elective hospital admissions and bed days can be explained by: the effects of the age distribution of the population, together with rising numbers of older people; cohort effects due to differing admission rates of people born in different years, and period effects, effects relating to a specific year which cannot be explained by either age or cohort effects. This time period was chosen to cover a time of significant policy upheaval in the NHS, including significant reforms to the ways in which hospitals were funded, managed and had patients referred to them. We find that most of the increase in elective admissions is due to the period effect. Elective bed-days have been decreasing, generally due to a shift towards day-cases. Emergency bed-day rates have remained consistent, with the effects of an ageing population being counteracted by increasingly healthy cohorts. These results suggest that demographic factors are not the primary drivers of growth in hospital use and that there may be a role for well-designed policy to influence the current trends.},

	abstract = {AIM: Older adults are frequently stigmatized for improper emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between age and appropriateness of ED visits, and the mismatching between ED clinical severity and hospitalizations.
METHODS: We carried out a nationwide assessment of Italian Informative System for the Emergency and Urgency data from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 including patients admitted to all the Italian EDs for any reason. Appropriateness of ED visits was defined as a yellow/red/black color code (potentially life-threatening/dead patients), whereas clinical severity/hospitalization mismatching was defined as hospital admission after validated ED green/white codes. Analyses dedicated to people aged ≥75 years were carried out.
RESULTS: There were 20 400 071 ED visits (3 444 091 aged ≥75 years), which increased with age, up to {\textgreater}650/1000 inhabitants aged ≥90 years. The appropriateness of ED visits increased with age, from 6.3\% in the 5-9 years age group to 44.2\% in the 95-99 years age group. Clinical severity/hospitalization mismatching decreased with age, from 62.9\% in the 30-34 years age group to 27.7\% in the 95-99 years age group. At ED presentation, 21.6\% of patients aged ≥75 years complained of non-specific symptoms, and hospital discharge diagnoses frequently differed from the ED admission diagnoses; 11.4\% died during hospitalization and 8.8\% were discharged to long-term care facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The request for ED care and the admission to acute care ward are commonly appropriate for older patients. Clinical presentation at ED admission is frequently atypical. Health care systems should aim at improving outpatients' management to reduce the ED care need, but also at optimizing in-hospital strategies and pathways for older adults.

The present study was aimed at re-testing this association in a 70-year-old age cohort (N = 1023), and testing whether it could be caused by excessive mortality of hyperinsulinemic subjects with high LDL-cholesterol. A reverse U-shaped association between LDL-cholesterol and fasting plasma insulin was confirmed. LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol were lowest in the highest insulin quarter. These associations remained after adjustment for diabetes, obesity and general health status. The combination of high LDL-cholesterol ({\textgreater} 4.25 mmol/L, 75th percentile) and high insulin ({\textgreater} 10 IU/L, 50th percentile) was not associated with excess 5-year mortality in this age cohort. Nor was it associated with excess mortality in four other elderly age cohorts (N = 1188), in which similar associations of cholesterol and insulin have been demonstrated. Thus, the inverse association of LDL-cholesterol with fasting insulin in the elderly is not caused by selective over mortality.},

	abstract = {Besides its role in the regulation of energy balance, leptin seems to be involved in linking energy stores to the reproductive system. A gender-dependent difference exists in plasma leptin concentration and leptin messenger ribonucleic acid expression in rodents and humans. This difference does not seem to be explained simply by differences in the amount of body fat between genders. To elucidate the relationship of endogenous testosterone and leptin, we studied the serum leptin concentrations in 269 elderly nondiabetic men. In addition, to assess whether exogenously administered testosterone could influence leptin production, we followed the serum levels of leptin in 10 healthy men during a 12-month treatment with 200 mg testosterone enanthate, i.m., weekly for contraceptive purposes. We found that the serum leptin concentration correlated inversely (r = -0.39; P {\textless} 0.001) with that of testosterone in elderly men. This inverse correlation was still present when body mass index and plasma insulin were included in the analysis. The administration of testosterone to young men suppressed serum leptin from the pretreatment level of 3.4 +/- 1.4 to 1.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L during the therapy. After cessation of testosterone injections, serum leptin concentration returned back to the pretreatment level. It is concluded that testosterone has a suppressive effect on leptin production, as reflected by circulating levels of this hormone.},

We also compare differences in morbidity and mortality between depressed and non-depressed persons. The depressed group of 50 persons in our follow-up study were selected randomly from among those persons who were diagnosed as having symptoms of depression, as shown in the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (n = 109). Persons (n = 50) who were not diagnosed as suffering from depression and who showed no signs of cognitive impairment (n = 833) were likewise chosen at random as a control group. We found that people suffering from symptoms of depression utilized institutional care, home health care and the outpatient clinics more than non-depressed people. Depressed people were more likely to suffer cardiovascular (p {\textless} 0.023) and pulmonary diseases (p {\textless} 0.04) than non-depressed controls. The mortality among depressed people was significantly higher than that in the control group. The results of our study give reason to believe that home-care staff are in a key position to identify depressed subjects. They have to understand the relationship between depression and the effect of various diseases on health and functional capacity.

Previous stroke (RR 5.82), history of transient ischemic attack (RR 4.14), diabetes mellitus (RR 2.50), poorly controlled hypertension (RR 2.42), smoking (RR 1.94) and male sex (RR 1.65) were independent risk factors for stroke. Atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure and previous myocardial infarction did not appear to be significant independent predictors of stroke in the elderly. The risk of stroke in the elderly population appears to be strongly related to the concomitant clinical disease, and this should be remembered when identifying persons at increased risk of stroke. Poorly controlled hypertension was associated with an increased risk of stroke. Thus, achieving a good control of blood pressure in elderly hypertensives receiving treatment has the potential to prevent strokes.},

DESIGN: prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: a sample of 1,032 non-institutionalised people aged 70 years in the Turku Elderly Study, Turku, Finland.
MEASUREMENTS: the association between IGT (defined as plasma glucose level between 7.80 and 11.09 mmol/l 2 h after administration of 75 g of an oral glucose load) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic medication, a fasting plasma glucose level of {\textgreater}/=7 mmol/l or a plasma glucose level of {\textgreater}/=11.1 mmol/l 2 h after administration of an oral glucose load) with 12-year follow-up for the development of ischaemic stroke.
RESULTS: a total of 742 (71.9\%) subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 127 (12.3\%) subjects had IGT and 163 (15.8\%) had DM. Patients were examined in the year 1990 and followed up for stroke occurrence until death or until the end of 2002. Mean follow-up time was 9.6 years (SD +/-3.3 years). In total, 119 patients (11.5\%) suffered a stroke during the follow-up. In logistic regression model, previous stroke, previous TIA, DM and atrial fibrillation were risk factors for stroke occurrence.
CONCLUSION: stroke tended to happen more often in the IGT group than in the normal group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Statistically significant risk factors for stroke in elderly people are previous TIA or stroke, DM and atrial fibrillation.},

AIM: To investigate how self-reported PLO changed among home-dwelling people from age 70 to 80 and 85 years.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, population-based 15-year follow-up study of the age cohort of 70-year-olds living in the city of Turku, Finland.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The data were collected in 1991 by a postal questionnaire that was sent to all residents of Turku, Finland, born in 1920 (N=1530). Follow-ups using the same procedure were conducted in 2001 and 2006. PLO was assessed with the following items: life satisfaction, feeling needed, having plans for the future, having zest for life, feeling depressed, and suffering from loneliness. We created a PLO score from the answers to these questions, where 1 represented the best PLO and 0 the poorest.
RESULTS: At baseline, the participants showed rather high levels of positive life orientation (PLO total score 0.83). PLO declined markedly after the 70-year-old participants reached the age of 80 and 85 years (p{\textless}.001). However, depressive feelings remained quite stable. The decrease was similar among men and women except for the items suffering from loneliness and feeling needed. At age 70 and 80 years women suffered more from loneliness than men, while men experienced feeling needed more than women.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive life orientation declines during old age, especially from age 70 to 80 years. Thereafter the decline is less steep except for changes in future plans and feeling needed.},

RESULTS: Many health-related factors, such as smoking, poor subjective health, and mobility, were related to an increased level of mortality. In addition, several diseases (e.g., diabetes, angina pectoris, cancer) at age 70 were associated with increased mortality over ten years. Difficulties in daily activities at age 70 also increased the risk of mortality.

METHODS: Four thousand three hundred and ninety patients were recorded in the FINMONICA and FINSTROKE registers after their first ischemic stroke from 1990 to 1998. We followed mortality and stroke outcome for up to 4 weeks after the onset of acute stroke.
RESULTS: Of the 4390 patients who had had an ischemic stroke, 43.6\% were male and 25.1\% (1103) had diabetes. Their mean age was 72.4 (S.D. 12.0) years and this was similar in patients with and without diabetes (72.9 years versus 72.3 years, p=0.18). Subjects with diabetes were more likely to be hypertensive (55\% versus 38\%, p{\textless}0.001) and have a history of myocardial infarction (20\% versus 16\%, p{\textless}0.001) than the non-diabetic stroke patients. Mortality at 4 weeks from the onset was higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients (20.0\% versus 16.9\% p=0.020). At day 28 after the stroke attack, diabetic patients were more likely to be disabled when compared with non-diabetic subjects (43.3\% versus 33.5\%, p{\textless}0.001). Using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age-group, sex, previous medical history (MI, AF or TIA), diabetes was found to be a significant predictor of disability after stroke (OR=1.51, 95\% CI 1.27-1.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, which affected one-fourth of the ischemic stroke patients on our register, was associated with a higher risk of death and disability after the onset of stroke. Preventing diabetes in the elderly population improves the short-term prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.},

METHODS: A prospective study with 5-, 10- and 27-year follow-ups. SRH (n = 1008) was assessed with a single question and OH (n = 962) by the Rockwood's Frailty Index (FI). To assess the association of SRH and OH with mortality, Cox regression model was used.
RESULTS: Of the 1008 participants, 138 (13.7\%), 319 (31.6\%), and 932 deceased (86.3\%) during the 5-, 10- and 27-year follow-ups, respectively. In unadjusted models, subjects with poor SRH had almost eightfold risk for mortality compared to those with good SRH during the 5-year follow-up; among those with poor OH, the risk was fourfold compared to those with good OH. In the 10-year-follow up, both poor SRH and poor OH predicted about fourfold risk for mortality compared to those with good health. During the 27-year follow-up, OH was a stronger predictor of mortality than SRH. Poor SRH, compared to good SRH, showed 95\% sensitivity and 34\% specificity for 5-year mortality; corresponding figures for OH were 54 and 80\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-item SRH seems to be able to capture almost the same as OH in predicting a short-term (less than 10 years) mortality risk among older adults in clinical settings. The use of SHR may also enhance the focus on patient-centered care.},

METHODS: Community-dwelling 70-year-old Finns were examined with similar examinations in 1991 (n = 1032) and in 2011 (n = 960). Dementia risk was assessed with the CAIDE Dementia Risk Score (CAIDE) (n = 1516), the Brief Dementia Risk Index (BDRI) (n = 1598) and the Dementia Screening Indicator (DSI) (n = 1462).
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with moderate or high risk for dementia was significantly higher in earlier than in later born cohort according to CAIDE (99\% and 94\%, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001) and BDRI (41\% and 15\%, p {\textless} 0.001), but not according to DSI (5\% and 6\%, p = 0.184). The total scores of the earlier born cohort were significantly higher than those of the later born cohort according to all three indices.
CONCLUSIONS: According to dementia risk indices, it seems that dementia risk has decreased among community-dwelling 70-year-old subjects during the last decades in Finland.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More recent birth cohorts of older people have better physical and cognitive status than earlier cohorts. As such, this could be expected to diminish the need for institutional care. The prediction of the future need for institutional care provides essential information for the planning and delivery of future care and social services as well as the resources needed.
OBJECTIVE: To predict the future need for institutional care among older Finnish people born in 1940.
METHODS: Representative samples of home-dwelling 70-year-olds from Turku, Finland were examined with similar methods in 1991 (those born in 1920) (n = 1,032) and in 2011 (those born in 1940) (n = 956). Predictors of institutionalization rates from the earlier 1920 cohort, together with data of sociodemographic factors, health, psychosocial and physical status, the need for help, and health behavior, were used to predict the future institutionalization rate among the 1940 cohort in this study using Cox regression models.
RESULTS: Health as well as psychosocial and physical status were significantly better in the 1940 cohort compared to the earlier cohort. In the 1940 cohort, the predicted rates of institutionalization were 1.8, 10.4, and 26.0\% at the ages of 80 (year 2020), 85 (year 2025), and 90 years (year 2030), respectively. At every age (80, 85, and 90 years), the predicted rates of institutionalization by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were about two-fold among those with MMSE scores 18-26 (3.0-38.8\%) compared to those with scores 27-30 (1.6-23.7\%) and those with a body mass index (BMI) {\textless}25 (2.5-34.3\%) compared to those with a BMI of 25-29.9 (1.4-20.9\%), and about three-fold among participants with several falls (5.3-57.0\%) compared to participants with no falls (1.5-23.1\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1940 cohort performed better in health as well as psychosocial and physical status than the 1920 cohort. Nevertheless, the predicted rates of future need for institutional care were high, especially at the ages of 85 and 90 years, among those with a lowered cognitive or physical status.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of the Brief Dementia Risk Index (BDRI) and incidence of dementia among community-dwelling Finnish older adults.
METHODS: Participants were community-dwelling nondemented 70-year-olds examined in 2011 (n = 943). Cox regression model with death as a competing risk was used to analyze the association of BDRI and incident dementia (ICD-10 codes F00-03 and G30) during the 5-year follow-up (n = 883).
RESULTS: The rate of dementia incidence was 4.9\% during the follow-up. Having at least moderate risk according to BDRI significantly predicted incident dementia (hazard ratio 3.18, 95\% confidence interval: 1.71-5.92, p {\textless} 0.001), also after adjustment with education level (2.93, 1.52-5.64, p = 0.001). No interaction between gender and BDRI was found.
CONCLUSION: BDRI could be an applicable tool for identification of older individuals at increased risk of developing dementia in clinical settings.},

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1032 non-institutionalized people aged 70 in the city of Turku, Southern Finland. The cohort population was recruited as part of a larger longitudinal aging study, the Turku Elderly Study. Fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c and triglycerides were measured, and the amount of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated at baseline. The cohort was followed for mortality for 12 years, and the causes of death were recorded and further classified into cardiovascular and other causes of death. The hazard ratios of dying for subjects in various cholesterol quartiles were computed by the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and pre-existing medical conditions.
RESULTS: Low levels of serum total cholesterol and HDL-c were associated with a greater risk of death over a follow-up of 12 years. After adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, the association between total cholesterol and survival changed. All-cause mortality seemed to be highest in the highest quartile of total cholesterol and nearly as high in the lowest quartile of total cholesterol, suggesting a U-shaped connection, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, cardiovascular mortality was significantly lowest in the lowest quartile of total cholesterol and significantly highest in the lowest quartile of HDL-c.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of serum total cholesterol and particularly low levels of HDL-c seem to be risk factors for cardiovascular mortality even in the elderly population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to compare cardiovascular morbidity and risk factor profiles of two 70-year-old cohorts of Finns examined in 1991 and 2011 and to describe prevalence of statin use according to cardiovascular risk in the later cohort.
METHODS: 1920-born cohort of community-dwelling 70-year-old persons (n = 1032) participated in comprehensive health surveys, physical and laboratory examinations in the Turku Elderly Study (TUVA) during 1991-92. In 2011, identical examination pattern was performed, in a 1940-born cohort of 70-year-old persons (n = 956) from the same area. Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and risk factors in the two cohorts was compared. Further, each cohort was divided into three cardiovascular risk groups (high, moderate and low) based on their estimated risk. Prevalence of statin use was calculated among each risk group in the 1940 cohort.
RESULTS: coronary heart disease (25 versus 11\%) and peripheral artery disease (9 versus 2\%) were more common in the 1920 than 1940 cohort, respectively. Lipid profile was worse and blood pressure higher in the earlier cohort, whereas use of statins and antihypertensives was more common in the later cohort. Forty-two per cent of the 1920 cohort and 29\% of the 1940 cohort were estimated to have high cardiovascular risk. In the 1940 cohort, a total of 36\% used statins. Statin use was most common among high-risk persons.
CONCLUSIONS: seventy-year olds examined in 2011 had less CVD morbidity than their counterparts 20 years earlier, and their cardiovascular risk factors were better controlled which is reflected in higher use of preventive medications, such as statins and antihypertensives.},

The aim of this paper is to describe recent trends in the prevalence and incidence of statin use among the Finnish older population, according to the person's estimated cardiovascular (CV) event risk.
METHODS: We conducted a register study covering the whole community-dwelling population of Finland, aged {\textgreater}70 years in 2000-2008 (N = 883,051). Data on reimbursed purchases of statins, antidiabetic and CV drugs, and pre-existing CV diseases were retrieved from comprehensive national registers. We stratified each person into low, moderate or high CV risk category, and according to age (70-74, 75-79, and {\textgreater}80 years) and sex.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, the age-sex-standardized prevalence of statin use tripled from 12.2 \% to 38.7 \% (rate ratio 3.0, 95 \% CI 3.0-3.1), and the incidence almost doubled (from 3.7 \% to 6.8 \%; rate ratio 1.8, 95 \% CI 1.8-1.9). The prevalence and incidence of statin use were consistently highest among high-risk persons. The greatest relative increases were observed in persons aged {\textgreater}80 years and in those at low risk; however, the proportion of statin users at low CV risk remained the same (∼7 \% of all users).
CONCLUSIONS: Statin prescribing is shifting towards older age groups. A substantial increase in prevalence and incidence was seen across all risk categories, but the channeling of statin use towards high-risk persons remained unchanged.},

Many agonists of platelet activation are known, but fewer endogenous inhibitors of platelets, such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO), have been identified. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, can cause bleeding in patients, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that acetylcholine is an endogenous inhibitor of platelets. We measured the effect of acetylcholine or analogs of acetylcholine on human platelet activation ex vivo. Acetylcholine and analogs of acetylcholine inhibited platelet activation, as measured by P-selectin translocation and glycoprotein IIb IIIa conformational changes. Conversely, we found that antagonists of the acetylcholine receptor, such as pancuronium, enhance platelet activation. Furthermore, drugs inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, such as donepezil, also inhibit platelet activation, suggesting that platelets release acetylcholine. We found that NO mediates acetylcholine inhibition of platelets. Our data suggest that acetylcholine is an endogenous inhibitor of platelet activation.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe a case of QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium associated with galantamine use and to analyze similar cases related to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC). CASE SUMMARY An 85-year-old man with dementia was treated with prolonged release galantamine 8 mg daily for 1.5 years. Three months prior to the current admission, he had a syncopal episode with low blood pressure and bradycardia. Two months later, galantamine was withdrawn, but within 2 weeks, the man developed marked cognitive, behavioral, and functional deterioration and galantamine was restarted. Three weeks later, he developed syncope, delirium, hypotension, and prolonged QT interval with serious cardiac arrhythmias, in addition to vomiting and diarrhea. A complete blood cell count and biochemistry panel performed on admission were normal. No infection was detected. Galantamine and irbesartan were ceased. The delirium fully resolved in 6 days, and the QT interval shortened from 503 to 443 msec (corrected by Bazett's formula) 4 days after discontinuation of galantamine and remained normal. DISCUSSION In the ADRAC reports, galantamine was associated with 18 cases of delirium/confusion, 8 of syncope, 13 of bradycardia, 6 of other arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, and 6 of hypotension. Donepezil was associated with 56, 15, 26, 15, and 5, and rivastigmine with 21, 8, 6, 2, and 2, respectively, of these reactions. Five fatal outcomes were reported in association with galantamine, 11 with donepezil, and 3 with rivastigmine, including 3, 6, and 0 sudden deaths, respectively. This case, along with previously published reports and cases identified from the ADRAC database, illustrates that AChIs may lead to delirium, syncope, hypotension, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that galantamine was the probable cause of QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium in this patient. CONCLUSIONS Administration of galantamine and other AChIs requires vigilance and assessment of risk factors that may precipitate QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium.},

This study aimed to evaluate evidence from the case report literature for an association between these agents and risk of QT interval prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmia. METHODS Published literature was mined with predetermined MeSH terms for each of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, to identify cases of QT interval prolongation and TdP. Case reports were analysed using causality scales and a QT interval nomogram. RESULTS A total of 13 case reports were found (10 for donepezil, 2 for galantamine and 1 for rivastigmine) with rate corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. Five cases with donepezil exhibited TdP. TdP was not reported in the cases with galantamine and rivastigmine. The use of a QT heart rate nomogram highlighted risk with donepezil compared with the other two drugs and the application of the Naranjo causality scale suggested probable or possible causation for all donepezil cases. All patients had at least two other risk factors for TdP, including modifiable risk factors such as electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, co-administration of QT prolonging drugs. A number of recent cases involved recent changes in medication. CONCLUSION Our evaluation of the case report literature suggests that there is evidence for a causal association between donepezil and QTc/TdP risk. Attention to risk factors for QTc prolongation/TdP should be exercised when prescribing donepezil and modifiable risk factors corrected. Owing to the low number of cases with galantamine and rivastigmine, further work is needed to establish whether these drugs may be more suitable than donepezil for patients with other risk factors for TdP.},

	abstract = {Background Hyperthyroidism has a well-described association with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the relation of hypothyroidism to AF has had limited investigation. Hypothyroidism is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical cardiovascular disease, and overt cardiovascular disease, all of which predispose to AF. We investigated 10-year incidence of AF in a community-dwelling cohort. Methods Among 6,653 Framingham heart Study participants, 5,069 participants, 52\% female, with mean age of 57 ?? 12 years, were eligible after excluding those with missing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), TSH {\textless}0.45 ??U/L (hyperthyroid), TSH {\textgreater}19.9 ??U/L, or prevalent AF. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was categorized by range (???0.45 to {\textless}4.5, 4.5 to {\textless}10.0, 10.0 to ???19.9 ??U/L) and by quartiles. We examined the associations between TSH and 10-year risk of AF using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results Over 10-year follow-up, we observed 277 cases of incident AF. A 1-SD increase in TSH was not associated with increased risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.01, 95\% CI 0.90-1.14, P =.83). In categorical analysis, using TSH ???0.45 to {\textless}4.5 ??U/L as the referent (equivalent to euthyroid state), we found no significant association between hypothyroidism and 10-year AF risk. Comparing the highest (2.6 {\textless} TSH {\textless} 19.9 ??U/L) to lowest (0.45 {\textless} TSH {\textless} 1.3 ??U/L) quartiles of TSH further did not identify a significant association between TSH levels and 10-year risk of AF. Conclusions In conclusion, we did not identify a significant association between hypothyroidism and 10-year risk of incident AF in a community-based study. ?? 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

	abstract = {The enhanced cardiovascular hemodynamics associated with triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) treatment is in part mediated by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. To determine the molecular mechanisms for the vasoactive properties of T3, we studied primary cultures of aortic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. Active tension development by the VSM cells was measured by deformation lines within a siloxane matrix on which the cells were grown. Exposure to T3 (10(-10) M) resulted in cellular relaxation within 10 min. Hormone binding studies to purified VSM cell plasma membranes identified two binding sites specific for T3 with Kd of 1 x 10(-11) and 6.1 x 10(-8) M. L-Thyroxine and reverse T3 did not compete for the L-T3 binding sites. To determine an intracellular signaling pathway of T3 action, cAMP and cGMP content were measured in VSM cell cultures treated with T3. No quantitative changes were observed in a time frame known to cause VSM cell relaxation. The level of myosin light chain phosphorylation is a major determinant of smooth muscle contraction. Thus, treatment of VSM cells with isoproterenol, a vasodilator, caused a significant decrease in radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into the myosin light chains, whereas T3 had no effect on phosphorylation of these proteins. Primary cultures of vascular endothelial cells exposed to T3 showed no nitric oxide production as measured by cellular cGMP content and nitrite release, suggesting that T3 acted directly on the VSM cell to cause vascular relaxation.},

	abstract = {Inflammation plays a central role in the development of atherosclerotic disease, from the early phases of lesion formation to plaque disruption, the main underlying cause of acute ischemic syndromes. Arachidonic acid metabolism is implicated in the pathophysiology of ischemic syndromes affecting the coronary or cerebrovascular territory, as demonstrated by biochemical measurements of eicosanoid biosynthesis and the results of inhibitor trials in these settings. In particular, much attention has been focused on the pathway catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX), which leads to the generation of a variety of lipid mediators known as prostanoids. Two COX isozymes have been characterized, COX-1 and COX-2, that differ in terms of regulatory mechanisms of expression, tissue distribution, substrate specificity, and preferential coupling to upstream and downstream enzymes. Whereas the role of platelet COX-1 in acute ischemic diseases is established, the role of COX-2 in atherothrombosis remains unclear. In this article, we summarize the findings from our group suggesting a crucial role for COX-2 in modulating atherosclerotic plaque stability or instability, according to the variable expression of upstream and downstream enzymes in the prostanoid biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Clinical hypertension is associated with raised serum IgG antibodies. However, whether antibodies are causative agents in hypertension remains unknown. We investigated whether hypertension in mice is associated with B-cell activation and IgG production and moreover whether B-cell/IgG deficiency affords protection against hypertension and vascular remodeling. Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion (0.7 mg/kg per day; 28 days) was associated with (1) a 25\% increase in the proportion of splenic B cells expressing the activation marker CD86, (2) an 80\% increase in splenic plasma cell numbers, (3) a 500\% increase in circulating IgG, and (4) marked IgG accumulation in the aortic adventitia. In B-cell-activating factor receptor-deficient (BAFF-R(-/-)) mice, which lack mature B cells, there was no evidence of Ang II-induced increases in serum IgG. Furthermore, the hypertensive response to Ang II was attenuated in BAFF-R(-/-) (Δ30±4 mm Hg) relative to wild-type (Δ41±5 mm Hg) mice, and this response was rescued by B-cell transfer. BAFF-R(-/-) mice displayed reduced IgG accumulation in the aorta, which was associated with 80\% fewer aortic macrophages and a 70\% reduction in transforming growth factor-β expression. BAFF-R(-/-) mice were also protected from Ang II-induced collagen deposition and aortic stiffening (assessed by pulse wave velocity analysis). Finally, like BAFF-R deficiency, pharmacological depletion of B cells with an anti-CD20 antibody attenuated Ang II-induced hypertension by ≈35\%. Hence, these studies demonstrate that B cells/IgGs are crucial for the development of Ang II-induced hypertension and vessel remodeling in mice. Thus, B-cell-targeted therapies-currently used for autoimmune diseases-may hold promise as future treatments for hypertension.},

	abstract = {Increased blood pressure (BP) variability predicts cardiovascular disease, but lack of operational thresholds limits its use in clinical practice. Our aim was to define outcome-driven thresholds for increased day-to-day home BP variability. We studied a population-based sample of 6238 individuals (mean age 60.0±12.9, 56.4\% women) from Japan, Greece, and Finland. All participants self-measured their home BP on ≥3 days. We defined home BP variability as the coefficient of variation of the first morning BPs on 3 to 7 days. We assessed the association between systolic/diastolic BP variability (as a continuous variable and in deciles of coefficient of variation) and cardiovascular outcomes using Cox regression models adjusted for cohort and classical cardiovascular risk factors, including BP. During a follow-up of 9.3±3.6 years, 304 cardiovascular deaths and 715 cardiovascular events occurred. A 1 SD increase in systolic/diastolic home BP variability was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.17/1.22; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.30/1.11-1.34; P=0.003/{\textless}0.0001) and cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.13/1.14; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05-1.21/1.07-1.23; P=0.0007/0.0002). Compared with the average risk in the whole population, risk of cardiovascular deaths (hazard ratio, 1.66/1.84; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27-2.17/1.42-2.37; P=0.0002/{\textless}0.0001) and events (hazard ratio, 1.46/1.42; 95\% confidence interval, 1.21-1.76/1.17-1.71; P{\textless}0.0001/0.0004) was increased in the highest decile of systolic/diastolic BP variability (coefficient of variation{\textgreater}11.0/12.8). Increased home BP variability predicts cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. Individuals with a systolic/diastolic coefficient of variation of day-to-day home BP {\textgreater}11.0/12.8 may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings could help physicians identify individuals who are at an increased cardiovascular disease risk.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.024},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Domestic violence is a hidden epidemic. We used a two-question screening tool to explore the prevalence of domestic violence among gynaecological outpatients. We also retrospectively assessed whether there was a change in the prevalence rate of self-reported violence after the launch of the \#MeToo movement.
STUDY DESIGN: Over an 11-month period, all gynaecological first-time visitors to our outpatient clinic were asked two dichotomous questions that screened for domestic violence and examined whether the violence had an ongoing impact on the respondent's everyday life. We used logistic regression models to assess whether the launch of \#MeToo was associated with the answers to these two questions.
RESULTS: Of the 6,957 screened women, 154 (2.2 \%) tested positive for domestic violence. Among the screen-positive women, 87 (56.5 \%) reported that the violence affected their health and well-being. Of these 87 women, 52.9 \% wanted further support and 72.4 \% had already contacted psychiatric care. Out of all of the patients, the proportion of screen-positive respondents was 2.3 \% before and 2.2 \% after \#MeToo. We did not detect increased odds of self-reporting domestic violence (odds ratio 0.97, 95 \% confidence interval 0.70-1.36) or its ongoing impact on the victim's everyday life (odds ratio 1.05, 95 \% confidence interval 0.53-2.07) after \#MeToo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our two-question screening tool detected a lower prevalence of domestic violence among gynaecological outpatients than previous reports examining the general population. Our results illustrate the dire challenges in screening for domestic violence that persist even in the post-\#MeToo era. Domestic violence remains a highly intimate, stigmatising, and underreported health issue, and systematic measures to screen for and prevent it should be advocated, both in gynaecological patients and the general population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies with mainly selected populations have proposed contradicting reference ranges for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and have disagreed on how screening, age and gender affect them. This study aimed to determine a TSH reference range on the Abbott Architect ci8200 integrated system in a large, nationwide, stratified random sample. To our knowledge this is the only study apart from the NHANES III that has addressed this issue in a similar nationwide setting. The effects of age, gender, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)-positivity and medications on TSH reference range were also assessed.
METHODS: TSH was measured from 6247 participants randomly drawn from the population register to represent the Finnish adult population. TSH reference ranges were established of a thyroid-healthy population and its subpopulations with increasing and cumulative rigour of screening: screening for overt thyroid disease (thyroid-healthy population, n=5709); screening for TPOAb-positivity (risk factor-free subpopulation, n=4586); and screening for use of any medications (reference subpopulation, n=1849).
RESULTS: The TSH reference ranges of the thyroid-healthy population, and the risk factor-free and reference subpopulations were 0.4-4.4, 0.4-3.7 and 0.4-3.4 mU/L (2.5th-97.5th percentiles), respectively. Although the differences in TSH between subgroups for age (p=0.002) and gender (p=0.005) reached statistical significance, the TSH distribution curves of the subgroups were practically superimposed.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose 0.4-3.4 mU/L as a TSH reference range for adults for this platform, which is lower than those presently used in most laboratories. Our findings suggest that intensive screening for thyroid risk factors, especially for TPOAb-positivity, decreases the TSH upper reference limit.},

This study aimed to investigate this association in cross-sectional and longitudinal settings in a nationwide, random sample representative of the Finnish adult population aged 30 and over.
METHODS: The study sample was randomly drawn from the population register. A total of 5655 participants were included in the baseline analyses and 3453 in the 11-year prospective analyses. The associations between baseline TSH and (i) BP and BP change over time; and (ii) prevalent and incident hypertension were assessed using linear and logistic models, adjusted for age, gender, smoking and body mass index.
RESULTS: A positive association (β ± standard error) was observed between TSH and diastolic (0·36 ± 0·12, P = 0·003) but not systolic BP (0·16 ± 0·21, P = 0·45) at baseline. TSH was negatively associated with 11-year BP change in men (systolic: -0·92 ± 0·41, P = 0·03; diastolic: -0·66 ± 0·26, P = 0·01) but not in women (P ≥ 0·09 for systolic and diastolic BP change). Participants in the highest TSH tertile within the TSH reference interval (0·4-3·4 mU/L), as compared with the lowest, had increased odds of prevalent (odds ratio 1·22, 95\% confidence interval 1·05-1·43, P = 0·01) but not incident hypertension (odds ratio 0·93, 95\% confidence interval 0·73-1·19, P = 0·58).
CONCLUSIONS: A modest association was found between increasing TSH and prevalent but not incident hypertension. TSH was inversely associated with BP change in men in our study. These findings contest an independent role of thyroid function at normal to near-normal levels in the pathogenesis of hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous data on the association of thyroid function with total mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are conflicting or limited. We investigated associations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with these outcomes in a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study. METHODS We examined 5211 participants representative of the Finnish population aged ≥30 years in 2000-2001 and followed them for a median of 13.2 years. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for baseline age, gender, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we assessed the associations of continuous baseline TSH and TSH categories (low [{\textless}0.4 mU/L], reference range [0.4-3.4 mU/L] and high [{\textgreater}3.4 mU/L]) with incident total mortality, SCD, coronary heart disease events, stroke, CVD, major adverse cardiac events and atrial fibrillation. RESULTS High TSH at baseline was related to a greater risk of total mortality (HR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.02-1.76) and SCD (HR 2.28, 95\% CI 1.13-4.60) compared with TSH within the reference range. High TSH was not associated with the other outcomes (P ≥ .51), whereas low TSH was not associated with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .09). TSH at baseline over the full range did not have a linear relation with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .17). TSH showed a U-shaped association with total mortality after a restricted cubic spline transformation (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Thyroid function abnormalities could be linked with higher risks of total mortality and SCD. Large-scale randomized studies are needed for evidence-based recommendations regarding treatment of mild thyroid failure.},

Methods: We recorded ECG and measured conventional cardiovascular risk factors in a nationwide population-based sample of 5813 Finns. We divided the participants into nonhypertensive (n¼3148) and hypertensive (n¼2665) individuals and followed the participants for incident atrial fibrillation events. We evaluated the predictive ability of 12 ECG abnormalities for atrial fibrillation using multivariable-adjusted Fine–Gray models. Results: During a follow-up of 11.92.9 years, 111 nonhypertensive and 301 hypertensive participants developed atrial fibrillation. Negative T wave in lateral leads predicted atrial fibrillation in both nonhypertensive [hazard ratio (HR), 4.59; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.84–11.44] and hypertensive participants (HR, 1.81; 95\% CI 1.16–2.84). In nonhypertensive participants, 1-SD increments in corrected QT interval (HR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.18–1.71) and T-wave amplitude in lead augmented vector R (aVR) (HR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.10–1.80) were related to atrial fibrillation. In hypertensive participants, prolonged PR interval (HR, 1.59; 95\% CI 1.05–2.41), prolonged P-wave duration (HR, 1.43; 95\% CI 1.07–1.91), left ventricular hypertrophy by Sokolow–Lyon criteria (HR, 1.55; 95\% CI, 1.12–2.14) and poor R-wave progression (HR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.02–2.48) predicted atrial fibrillation. Corrected QT interval and T-wave amplitude in lead aVR were stronger predictors of atrial fibrillation in nonhypertensive than in hypertensive participants. ECG abnormalities improved risk prediction only marginally (delta area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve¼0.000–0.005). Conclusion: Several ECG abnormalities associate with incident atrial fibrillation in hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals but provide only marginal incremental predictive value. Corrected QT interval and T-wave amplitude in lead aVR may relate stronger to incident atrial fibrillation in nonhypertensive than in hypertensive individuals.},

Results The incidence rates of prolonged P-wave duration, abnormal P terminal force (PTF), left P-wave axis deviation, and right P-wave axis deviation were 16.0\%, 7.4\%, 3.4\%, and 2.2\%, respectively. Older age and higher BMI were associated with incident prolonged P-wave duration and abnormal PTF (P ≤ 0.01). Higher blood pressure was associated with incident prolonged P-wave duration and right P-wave axis deviation (P ≤ 0.01). During follow-up, only prolonged P-wave duration predicted AF (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.38; P = 0.001).

	abstract = {Objective: The present cross-sectional study investigated whether central SBP and pulse pressure (PP) measured noninvasively with a novel cuff-based stand-alone monitor are more strongly associated with hypertensive end-organ damage than corresponding brachial measures. Methods: We investigated the cross-sectional association of central versus brachial SBP and PP with echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI), LV hypertrophy (LVH), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and increased IMT (IMT ≥ 75th percentile) among 246 participants drawn from the general population (mean age 57.2 years, 55.3\% women). Results: All blood pressure (BP) measures were positively correlated with LVMI and IMT (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). Brachial and central SBP correlated equally strongly with LVMI (r = 0.42 versus 0.40, P for difference 0.19) and IMT (r = 0.32 versus 0.33, P = 0.60). However, brachial PP correlated more strongly than central PP with LVMI (r = 0.34 versus 0.27, P = 0.03) and IMT (r = 0.40 versus 0.35, P = 0.04). In multivariable-adjusted logistic models, all four BP measures were significantly associated with LVH and increased IMT (P ≤ 0.03 for all). However, the diagnostic accuracy of logistic regression models that included brachial or central hemodynamic parameters was similar for LVH [area under curve (AUC) for SBP: 0.74 versus 0.76, P = 0.16; AUC for PP: 0.75 versus 0.73, P = 0.35] and IMT (AUC for SBP: 0.61 versus 0.61, P = 0.67; AUC for PP: 0.63 versus 0.61, P = 0.29). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that central SBP and PP measured with a stand-alone noninvasive BP monitor do not improve diagnostic accuracy for end-organ damage over corresponding brachial measures.},

	abstract = {Aims: Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause damage to the gastric and duodenal mucosa. Some probiotics have proven useful in ameliorating the harmful side-effects of NSAIDs. Our aim was to evaluate whether oral administration of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 (B420) can attenuate the increase of calprotectin excretion into faeces induced by intake of diclofenac sustained-release tablets. Methods: A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical study was performed in 50 healthy male and female volunteers aged 20–40 years, in Finland. Study participation consisted of 4 phases: run-in, intervention with B420 or placebo, B420 or placebo + NSAID treatment, and follow-up. The primary outcome was the concentration of calprotectin in faeces. Secondary outcomes were haemoglobin and microbial DNA in faeces and blood haemoglobin levels. Results: Intake of diclofenac increased the faecal excretion of calprotectin in both groups. The observed increases were 48.19 ± 61.55 μg/g faeces (mean ± standard deviation) in the B420 group and 31.30 ± 39.56 μg/g in the placebo group (difference estimate 16.90; 95\% confidence interval: −14.00, 47.77; P =.276). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in changes of faecal or blood haemoglobin. Faecal B. lactis DNA was much more abundant in the B420 group compared to the placebo group (ANOVA estimate for treatment difference 0.85 × 109/g faeces; 95\% confidence interval: 0.50 × 109, 1.21 × 109; P {\textless}.0001). Conclusions: Short-term administration of the probiotic B420 did not protect the healthy adult study participants from diclofenac-induced gastrointestinal inflammation as determined by analysis of faecal calprotectin levels.},

Background: Thyroid hormone homeostasis is vital to the optimal functioning of the cardiovascular system, but an independent prognostic effect of thyroid abnormalities in patients with HF has not been established. Methods: In SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial), which randomized patients with ischemic or nonischemic HF to placebo or amiodarone or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured at baseline and at 6-month intervals throughout the 5-year study. Results: Of 2,225 patients, the majority (87\%) had normal TSH levels (0.3 to 5.0 ??U/ml) at baseline, 12\% had values suggestive of hypothyroidism, and 1\% had values consistent with hyperthyroidism. Compared with euthyroid patients, those hypothyroid at baseline were older and included more women and Caucasians (all p values {\textless}0.05). Over the median follow-up period of 45.5 months, among patients euthyroid at baseline, 89 developed abnormally low TSH levels, and 341 developed abnormally high values. Patients randomized to amiodarone (median dose 300 mg) had an elevated risk for developing abnormal TSH levels compared with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy or placebo (p {\textless} 0.0001). Patients with baseline or new-onset abnormal thyroid function had a higher mortality than those with normal thyroid function, even after controlling for other known mortality predictors (hazard ratio: 1.58; 95\% confidence interval: 1.29 to 1.94; p {\textless} 0.0001 for hypothyroid; hazard ratio: 1.85; 95\% confidence interval: 1.21 to 2.83; p = 0.0048 for hyperthyroid).

METHODS Reports of TdP from January 2004 through December 2007 were retrieved from the public version of the AERS database. All reports were selected from REACTION files and the relevant suspected and/or interacting drugs were identified from DRUG files. Qualitative analysis was performed by the case/non-case method. Cases were represented by TdP reports, whereas non-cases were all reports of adverse drug reactions other than TdP. Quantitative analysis was assessed by calculating the crude and adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR), as a measure of disproportionality, with the 95\% confidence interval. RESULTS Reports of TdP were 1665 over a 4-year period, involving 376 active substances. Thirty-five drugs with at least 10 reports were identified: amiodarone and methadone were associated with the highest number of cases (113 and 83 respectively) and most of the other reports were ascribable to antibacterials, antidepressants and antipsychotics; remarkable differences in number of cases and ROR were present among agents within each therapeutic class. A disproportionate reporting was also observed for other compounds such as donepezil, famotidine and mitoxantrone. CONCLUSIONS Large spontaneous reporting databases represent an important source for signal detection of rare adverse drug reactions (ADR), such as TdP. The number of reports associated to donepezil, famotidine and mitoxantrone could be considered unexpected on the basis of current evidence and needs further investigations on their true TdP-liability.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of data from the EMERGE and ENGAGE trials, which were 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 randomized clinical trials that compared low-dose and high-dose aducanumab treatment with placebo among participants at 348 sites across 20 countries. Enrollment occurred from August 2015 to July 2018, and the trials were terminated early (March 21, 2019) based on a futility analysis. The combined studies consisted of a total of 3285 participants with Alzheimer disease who received 1 or more doses of placebo (n = 1087) or aducanumab (n = 2198; 2752 total person-years of exposure) during the placebo-controlled period. Primary data analyses were performed from November 2019 to July 2020, with additional analyses performed through July 2021. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to high-dose or low-dose intravenous aducanumab or placebo once every 4 weeks. Dose titration was used as a risk-minimization strategy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain magnetic resonance imaging was used to monitor patients for ARIA; associated symptoms were reported as adverse events. RESULTS Of 3285 included participants, the mean (SD) age was 70.4 (7.45) years; 1706 participants (52\%) were female, 2661 (81\%) had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease, and 1777 (54\%) used symptomatic medications for Alzheimer disease. A total of 764 participants from EMERGE and 709 participants from ENGAGE were categorized as withdrawn before study completion, most often owing to early termination of the study by the sponsor. Unless otherwise specified, all results represent analyses from the 10-mg/kg group. During the placebo-controlled period, 425 of 1029 patients (41.3\%) experienced ARIA, with serious cases occurring in 14 patients (1.4\%). ARIA-edema (ARIA-E) was the most common adverse event (362 of 1029 [35.2\%]), and 263 initial events (72.7\%) occurred within the first 8 doses of aducanumab; 94 participants (26.0\%) with an event exhibited symptoms. Common associated symptoms among 103 patients with symptomatic ARIA-E or ARIA-H were headache (48 [46.6\%]), confusion (15 [14.6\%]), dizziness (11 [10.7\%]), and nausea (8 [7.8\%]). Incidence of ARIA-E was highest in aducanumab-treated participants who were apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriers. Most events (479 of 488 [98.2\%]) among those with ARIA-E resolved radiographically; 404 of 488 (82.8\%) resolved within 16 weeks. In the placebo group, 29 of 1076 participants (2.7\%) had ARIA-E (apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers: 16 of 742 [2.2\%]; noncarriers, 13 of 334 [3.9\%]). ARIA-microhemorrhage and ARIA-superficial siderosis occurred in 197 participants (19.1\%) and 151 participants (14.7\%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this integrated safety data set from EMERGE and ENGAGE, the most common adverse event in the 10-mg/kg group was ARIA-E, which occurred in 362 of the 1029 patients (35.2\%) in the 10-mg/kg group with at least 1 postbaseline MRI scan, with 94 patients (26.0\%) experiencing associated symptoms. The most common associated symptom was headache. TRIAL REGISTRATIONS ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02484547, NCT02477800.},

	abstract = {Significance: A diverse family of lipid-derived levulinaldehydes, isolevuglandins (isoLGs), is produced by rearrangement of endoperoxide intermediates generated through both cyclooxygenase (COX) and free radical-induced cyclooxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their phospholipid esters. The formation and reactions of isoLGs with other biomolecules has been linked to alcoholic liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, atherosclerosis, cardiac arythmias, cancer, end-stage renal disease, glaucoma, inflammation of allergies and infection, mitochondrial dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, and thrombosis. This review chronicles progress in understanding the chemistry of isoLGs, detecting their production in vivo and understanding their biological consequences. Critical Issues: IsoLGs have never been isolated from biological sources, because they form adducts with primary amino groups of other biomolecules within seconds. Chemical synthesis enabled investigation of isoLG chemistry and detection of isoLG adducts present in vivo. Recent Advances: The first peptide mapping and sequencing of an isoLG-modified protein present in human retina identified the modification of a specific lysyl residue of the sterol C27-hydroxylase Cyp27A1. This residue is preferentially modified by iso[4]LGE{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in vitro, causing loss of function. Adduction of less than one equivalent of isoLG can induce COX-associated oligomerization of the amyloid peptide Aβ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1-42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Adduction of isoLGE{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to phosphatidylethanolamines causes gain of function, converting them into proinflammatory isoLGE{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-PE agonists that foster monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Future Directions: Among the remaining questions on the biochemistry of isoLGs are the dependence of biological activity on isoLG isomer structure, the structures and mechanism of isoLG-derived protein-protein and DNA-protein cross-link formation, and its biological consequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Low serum thyrotropin concentrations are a sensitive indicator of hyperthyroidism but can also occur in persons who have no clinical manifestations of the disorder. We studied whether low serum thyrotropin concentrations in clinically euthyroid older persons are a risk factor for subsequent atrial fibrillation. METHODS We studied 2007 persons (814 men and 1193 women) 60 years of age or older who did not have atrial fibrillation in order to determine the frequency of this arrhythmia during a 10-year follow-up period. The subjects were classified according to their serum thyrotropin concentrations: those with low values ({\textless} or = 0.1 mU per liter; 61 subjects); those with slightly low values ({\textgreater} 0.1 to 0.4 mU per liter; 187 subjects); those with normal values ({\textgreater} 0.4 to 5.0 mU per liter; 1576 subjects); and those with high values ({\textgreater} 5.0 mU per liter; 183 subjects). RESULTS During the 10-year follow-up period, atrial fibrillation occurred in 13 persons with low initial values for serum thyrotropin, 23 with slightly low values, 133 with normal values, and 23 with high values. The cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation at 10 years was 28 percent among the subjects with low serum thyrotropin values ({\textless} or = 0.1 mU per liter), as compared with 11 percent among those with normal values; the age-adjusted incidence of atrial fibrillation was 28 per 1000 person-years among those with low values and 10 per 1000 person-years among those with normal values (P = 0.005). After adjustment for other known risk factors, the relative risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly subjects with low serum thyrotropin concentrations, as compared with those with normal concentrations, was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 5.5; P {\textless} 0.001). The 10-year incidence of atrial fibrillation in the groups with slightly low and high serum thyrotropin values was not significantly different from that in the group with normal values. CONCLUSIONS Among people 60 years of age or older, a low serum thyrotropin concentration is associated with a threefold higher risk that atrial fibrillation will develop in the subsequent decade.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Electrocardiographically assessed left-ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) is a particularly high-risk phenomenon that is a part of every hypertensive patient's initial work-up. Several cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that home blood pressure (BP) has a stronger relation to LVH than office BP. However, longitudinal evidence on the association between home BP and target organ damage is scarce to nonexistent. METHODS We studied in a sample of 615 community-dwelling participants (mean age at baseline 53.7 ± 7.2, 58\% women) whether change in home BP is more strongly associated with change in ECG-LVH than change in office BP over an 11-year follow-up. RESULTS Pearson's correlation coefficients between changes in home/office SBP and changes in Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage, Cornell product and R wave amplitude in aVL were 0.21/0.18, 0.28/0.17, 0.25/0.16, and 0.32/0.20, respectively (asterisk indicates P {\textless} 0.05 for between-method difference in correlations with Steiger's z test). For change in home/office DBP and change in the aforementioned ECG-LVH indexes, the correlations were 0.12/0.12, 0.20/0.15, 0.16/0.12, and 0.28/0.19. Multivariable-adjusted regression modelling provided similar results. No clinically significant increase in correlations between home BP and ECG-LVH indexes occurred after the fourth day of home BP measurement. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates for the first time the superiority of home BP over office BP in the follow-up of left ventricular mass. The results of this and previous studies underline the importance of using out-of-office BP measurements as the primary method for assessing blood pressure levels.},

We compared the risk of progression to SHT (office BP ≥140/90 mmHg and home BP ≥135/85 mmHg or start of treatment with antihypertensive medication) between 528 participants with normotension (office BP {\textless}140/90 mmHg and home BP {\textless}135/85 mmHg), 142 participants with WCHT (office BP ≥140/90 mmHg and home BP {\textless} 135/85 mmHg), and 63 participants with MHT (office BP {\textless} 140/90 mmHg and home BP ≥135/85 mmHg) at baseline. We used the χ test and a multivariable-adjusted log-binomial regression model to evaluate the association between baseline BP categories and incident SHT.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: During an 11-year follow-up, the rate of progression to SHT increased from normotension (18\%) to WCHT (52\%) and MHT (73\%), P {\textless} 0.0001. Progression to SHT became more likely with an increasing baseline home BP category (Ptrend {\textless} 0.0001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies with mainly selected populations have proposed contradicting reference ranges for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and have disagreed on how screening, age and gender affect them. This study aimed to determine a TSH reference range on the Abbott Architect ci8200 integrated system in a large, nationwide, stratified random sample. To our knowledge this is the only study apart from the NHANES III that has addressed this issue in a similar nationwide setting. The effects of age, gender, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)-positivity and medications on TSH reference range were also assessed.
METHODS: TSH was measured from 6247 participants randomly drawn from the population register to represent the Finnish adult population. TSH reference ranges were established of a thyroid-healthy population and its subpopulations with increasing and cumulative rigour of screening: screening for overt thyroid disease (thyroid-healthy population, n=5709); screening for TPOAb-positivity (risk factor-free subpopulation, n=4586); and screening for use of any medications (reference subpopulation, n=1849).
RESULTS: The TSH reference ranges of the thyroid-healthy population, and the risk factor-free and reference subpopulations were 0.4-4.4, 0.4-3.7 and 0.4-3.4 mU/L (2.5th-97.5th percentiles), respectively. Although the differences in TSH between subgroups for age (p=0.002) and gender (p=0.005) reached statistical significance, the TSH distribution curves of the subgroups were practically superimposed.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose 0.4-3.4 mU/L as a TSH reference range for adults for this platform, which is lower than those presently used in most laboratories. Our findings suggest that intensive screening for thyroid risk factors, especially for TPOAb-positivity, decreases the TSH upper reference limit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of longitudinal studies on the association between thyroid function and blood pressure (BP) are divided. This study aimed to investigate this association in cross-sectional and longitudinal settings in a nationwide, random sample representative of the Finnish adult population aged 30 and over.
METHODS: The study sample was randomly drawn from the population register. A total of 5655 participants were included in the baseline analyses and 3453 in the 11-year prospective analyses. The associations between baseline TSH and (i) BP and BP change over time; and (ii) prevalent and incident hypertension were assessed using linear and logistic models, adjusted for age, gender, smoking and body mass index.
RESULTS: A positive association (β ± standard error) was observed between TSH and diastolic (0·36 ± 0·12, P = 0·003) but not systolic BP (0·16 ± 0·21, P = 0·45) at baseline. TSH was negatively associated with 11-year BP change in men (systolic: -0·92 ± 0·41, P = 0·03; diastolic: -0·66 ± 0·26, P = 0·01) but not in women (P ≥ 0·09 for systolic and diastolic BP change). Participants in the highest TSH tertile within the TSH reference interval (0·4-3·4 mU/L), as compared with the lowest, had increased odds of prevalent (odds ratio 1·22, 95\% confidence interval 1·05-1·43, P = 0·01) but not incident hypertension (odds ratio 0·93, 95\% confidence interval 0·73-1·19, P = 0·58).
CONCLUSIONS: A modest association was found between increasing TSH and prevalent but not incident hypertension. TSH was inversely associated with BP change in men in our study. These findings contest an independent role of thyroid function at normal to near-normal levels in the pathogenesis of hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Scant data exist on the longitudinal association between thyroid function and lipid concentrations. We investigated associations of TSH and lipid concentrations cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a nationwide population sample. METHODS A total of 5205 randomly sampled participants representative of Finns aged ≥30 years were examined in 2000-2001 and included in cross-sectional analyses. A total of 2486 were re-examined 11 years later and included in longitudinal analyses. With linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, smoking and body mass index, we assessed the associations of baseline TSH and TSH categories (low, reference range and high) with total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; apolipoprotein A1 and B; and triglycerides at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS At baseline, higher TSH associated with higher total cholesterol (β = 0·025, standard error [SE] = 0·007, P {\textless} 0·001), LDL cholesterol (β = 0·020, SE = 0·007, P = 0·002), apolipoprotein B (β = 0·006, SE = 0·002, P {\textless} 0·001) and log triglycerides (β = 0·008, SE = 0·003, P = 0·004), but not with other lipid outcomes. Higher baseline TSH associated with higher total cholesterol (β = 0·056, SE = 0·026, P = 0·033), LDL cholesterol (β = 0·057, SE = 0·023, P = 0·015) and apolipoprotein B (β = 0·012, SE = 0·006, P = 0·028) at follow-up in women, but not with any lipid outcomes in men. Participants with high TSH at baseline had a 0·22 mmol/l (95\% confidence interval 0·02-0·41 mmol/l) higher LDL cholesterol at follow-up (P = 0·028) than participants with TSH in the reference range (0·4-3·4 mU/l). However, exclusion of participants with high-risk baseline lipid values rendered these positive longitudinal associations nonsignificant (P ≥ 0·098). CONCLUSIONS We could confirm a modest association between higher TSH and an adverse lipid profile cross-sectionally but not indisputably longitudinally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous data on the association of thyroid function with total mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are conflicting or limited. We investigated associations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with these outcomes in a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study. METHODS We examined 5211 participants representative of the Finnish population aged ≥30 years in 2000-2001 and followed them for a median of 13.2 years. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for baseline age, gender, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we assessed the associations of continuous baseline TSH and TSH categories (low [{\textless}0.4 mU/L], reference range [0.4-3.4 mU/L] and high [{\textgreater}3.4 mU/L]) with incident total mortality, SCD, coronary heart disease events, stroke, CVD, major adverse cardiac events and atrial fibrillation. RESULTS High TSH at baseline was related to a greater risk of total mortality (HR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.02-1.76) and SCD (HR 2.28, 95\% CI 1.13-4.60) compared with TSH within the reference range. High TSH was not associated with the other outcomes (P ≥ .51), whereas low TSH was not associated with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .09). TSH at baseline over the full range did not have a linear relation with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .17). TSH showed a U-shaped association with total mortality after a restricted cubic spline transformation (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Thyroid function abnormalities could be linked with higher risks of total mortality and SCD. Large-scale randomized studies are needed for evidence-based recommendations regarding treatment of mild thyroid failure.},

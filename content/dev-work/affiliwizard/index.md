**AffiliWizard v1.0.0** is a lightweight GUI tool created by Ville Lang√©n, designed to solve a common problem in academic writing: formatting author-affiliation lists with proper numbering and structure.

### The Problem

When writing academic papers with multiple authors from different institutions, creating a properly formatted author-affiliation list can be tedious and error-prone. You often need to:

- Number affiliations sequentially
- Match authors to their respective institutions
- Format everything consistently
- Export to various formats for different journals

### The Solution

AffiliWizard streamlines this process with a simple, intuitive interface that transforms your Excel data into professionally formatted author lists.

### Key Features

- **Simple Copy-Paste Interface**: Copy data directly from Excel spreadsheets
- **Automatic Numbering**: Intelligently assigns superscript numbers to affiliations
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Save as .docx, .html, or plain text
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for macOS, Windows, and web browsers
- **No Installation Required**: Use the online version instantly

### How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Organize your author-affiliation data in Excel with columns for:
   - Author Name (including degrees/titles)
   - Affiliation 1
   - Affiliation 2 (optional)
   - Additional affiliations as needed

2. **Copy and Paste**: Select and copy your data from Excel, then paste it into AffiliWizard's text box

3. **Export**: Choose your preferred format (.docx, HTML, or Plain Text) and save

### Input Format Example

Author Name          | Affiliation 1              | Affiliation 2

Jane Doe, MD         | Sample University, TX, USA |
```

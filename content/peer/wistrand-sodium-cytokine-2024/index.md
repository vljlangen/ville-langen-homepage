abstract: 'PURPOSE: The complex pathogenesis of hypertension, potentially involving inflammatory pathways, remains elusive. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and inflammatory cytokines alongside C-reactive protein (CRP) in a nationwide Finnish sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 265 participants from the FINRISK 2002 study were included. Multivariable-adjusted associations of 24-hour urinary sodium with circulating CRP and 26 cytokines were examined. RESULTS: 24-hour urinary sodium was not significantly associated with any of the cytokines or CRP (p ≥ 0.02 for all, significance at <0.001). Adjustments for age, sex, serum creatinine, and alcohol intake did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed no associations between 24-hour urinary sodium and cytokine or CRP levels. Additional research is required to clarify the mechanisms through which salt may induce hypertension.'

abstract: Observational and interventional studies have unequivocally demonstrated
  that \"present\", i.e. single-occasion, blood pressure is one of the key determinants
  of cardiovascular disease risk. Over the past two decades, however, numerous publications
  have suggested that longitudinal blood pressure data and assessment of long-term
  blood pressure exposure provide incremental prognostic value over present blood
  pressure. These studies have used several different indices to quantify the overall
  exposure to blood pressure, such as time-averaged blood pressure, cumulative blood
  pressure, blood pressure trajectory patterns, and age of hypertension onset. This
  review summarises existing research on the association between these indices and
  hard cardiovascular outcomes, outlines the strengths and weaknesses of these indices,
  and provides an overview of how longitudinal blood pressure changes can be measured
  and used to improve cardiovascular disease risk prediction.KEY MESSAGESNumerous
  recent publications have examined the relation between cardiovascular disease and
  long-term blood pressure (BP) exposure, quantified using indices such as time-averaged
  BP, cumulative BP, BP trajectory patterns, and age of hypertension onset.This review
  summarises existing research on the association between these indices and hard cardiovascular
  outcomes, outlines the strengths and weaknesses of these indices, and provides an
  overview of how longitudinal BP changes can be measured and used to improve cardiovascular
  disease risk prediction.Although longitudinal BP indices seem to predict cardiovascular
  outcomes better than present BP, there are considerable differences in the clinical
  feasibility of these indices along with a limited number of prospective data.

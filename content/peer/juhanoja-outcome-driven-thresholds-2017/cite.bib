  abstract = {Increased blood pressure (BP) variability predicts cardiovascular disease, but lack of operational thresholds limits its use in clinical practice. We aimed to define outcome-driven thresholds for increased day-to-day home BP variability. We studied 6238 individuals (mean age 60.0$\pm$12.9, 56.4\% women) from Japan, Greece, and Finland. Home BP variability was defined as the coefficient of variation of the first morning BPs on 3 to 7 days. During follow-up of 9.3$\pm$3.6 years, 304 cardiovascular deaths and 715 cardiovascular events occurred. A 1 SD increase in systolic/diastolic home BP variability was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.17/1.22; 95\% CI 1.06--1.30/1.11--1.34) and cardiovascular events (HR 1.13/1.14; 95\% CI 1.05--1.21/1.07--1.23). Risk was increased in the highest decile of systolic/diastolic BP variability (coefficient of variation >11.0/12.8). Individuals with systolic/diastolic coefficient of variation of day-to-day home BP >11.0/12.8 may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease; these thresholds could help identify individuals at increased cardiovascular risk.},

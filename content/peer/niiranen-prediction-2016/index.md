abstract: The authors investigated whether a genetic risk score (GRS) constructed
  of 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms would predict incident hypertension and blood
  pressure (BP) change over time in a population cohort during an 11-year follow-up
  (n=5402 at baseline, 3266 at follow-up). In multivariable models, GRS was associated
  with higher systolic/diastolic BP values at baseline (β±standard error [SE], 1.04±0.14/1.11±0.13
  mm Hg; Ptextless.0001 for both) and at reinvestigation (β±SE, 0.84±0.18/0.79±0.16
  mm Hg; Ptextless.0001 for both). Among participants who were normotensive at baseline
  (n=2045), GRS was not independently associated with systolic/diastolic BP change
  over time (β±SE, 0.16±0.18/0.20±0.18 mm Hg; P≥.28 for both). In participants in
  the top tertile of the GRS, as compared with the bottom tertile, the predicted increase
  in systolic/diastolic BP was 1.18±0.78/0.70±0.49 mm Hg (P=.046/.15) greater and
  the odds ratio for incident hypertension was 33% higher (P=.03). These data show
  that GRS is strongly associated with BP but weakly associated with BP increase and
  incident hypertension in a late middle-aged population.

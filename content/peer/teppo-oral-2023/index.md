abstract: 'Objectives: The impact of oral anticoagulants (OACs) on the need of long-term
  care (LTC) in the aging and multimorbid population of patients with atrial ﬁbrillation
  (AF) is unknown. We conducted a nationwide cohort study to evaluate the effect of
  OACs on the need of LTC. Design: Retrospective nationwide cohort study. Setting
  and Participants: The registry-based FinACAF cohort study covers all patients with
  incident AF from all levels of care in Finland from 2007 to 2018, as well as all
  their OAC purchases, LTC admissions, and information on previous home care acuity.
  Methods: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of LTC admission were calculated using Poisson
  regression models with a Lexis-type data structure based on 3 time scales: follow-up
  time from AF diagnosis, calendar year, and age. Results: We identiﬁed 188,752 patients
  (49.0% female; mean age 71.4 years; mean follow-up 3.6 years) with incident AF without
  prior LTC, of whom 143,534 (76.0 %) initiated OAC therapy and 11,775 (6.2 %) were
  admitted to LTC. OAC therapy was associated with lower rates of LTC admission (adjusted
  IRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.82). When compared to warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants
  (DOACs) were associated with lower LTC admission rate (adjusted IRR 0.69, 95% CI
  0.61-0.79). No signiﬁcant disparities were observed between different DOACs. Conclusions
  and Implications: OAC therapy, particularly with DOACs, is associated with a substantially
  lower risk of admission to LTC in patients with AF. Increasing guideline-based OAC
  coverage among patients with AF may prevent the need of LTC, lengthen survival at
  home, and potentially decrease health care costs.'

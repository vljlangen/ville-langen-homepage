## About Me

I am a medical professional, board-certified as a specialist physician in cardiology, internal medicine, and geriatrics, holding an MD and a PhD. Alongside my clinical practice, I am actively engaged in teaching and mentoring medical students and residents.

With a passion for data analysis and a keen interest in the intersection of medicine and data science, I pursue healthcare data exploration and the development of open-source educational materials alongside my clinical and teaching work. My aim is to bridge the gap between medicine and technology, making complex medical concepts more accessible to learners worldwide.

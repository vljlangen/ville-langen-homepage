abstract: ECG findings complicate drug treatment of memory disorders  Background Anti-dementia
  drugs have potential cardiac effects, but clinicians’ practices regarding ECG interpretation
  in the treatment of memory disorders have not been studied. International guidelines
  have not delineated which ECG findings should be contraindications for initiating
  anti-dementia medication.  Methods Clinicians’ views on which ECG changes are contraindications
  for initiating treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were collected
  with a web-based questionnaire.  Results A total of 157 physicians responded to
  the survey. Of these, 71% were geriatricians. More than half (63%) of the physicians
  experienced that ECG changes complicated treatment at least to some extent. The
  findings most commonly considered contraindications for AChEI initiation or dose
  increase were second-degree AV block (90% and 85%, respectively) and sinus bradycardia
  (84% and 86%, respectively), but the responses showed considerable variation. Neither
  special competence in the treatment of memory disorders (p = 0.06), the patient’s
  age (p = 0.25) nor comorbidities (p = 0.07) affected whether the ECG was always
  evaluated before initiating AChEI medication.  Conclusions Our findings indicate
  considerable divergence in physicians’ opinions on which ECG changes are contraindications
  for AChEIs. The importance of ECG changes for AChEI treatment warrants further research.

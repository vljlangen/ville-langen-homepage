abstract: 'Mysterious chin ache, double vision and shattering red blood cells  A previously
  independent, nearly 80-year-old patient came to the university hospital emergency
  room because of recently appeared double vision, facial pain and vertigo. The computed
  tomography and -angiography of the head showed no abnormality. A clinical diagnosis
  of trochlear nerve palsy due to a microinfarction was established. Her condition
  became soon worse: she had constant pain in the right side of her face. She visited
  two dentists and an ear, nose and throat specialist twice, but the examinations
  showed no abnormality. Eventually she fell because of vertigo and was examined again
  at the emergency room. Thereafter, she was referred for further examination to the
  geriatric outpatient clinic, where a pericardial effusion was found in the echocardiogram.
  She was admitted to the city hospital medical ward. Six years earlier, she had been
  diagnosed with mixed AIHA, which had been symptomless since then, but now the anemia
  and hemolysis had emerged again. The patient had fever up to 38°C, but C-reactive
  protein was low (textless1 mg/l). She was tested for several possible infections
  that could have triggered AIHA and the pericardial effusion. These examinations
  finally led to the source of these complex symptoms, as both IgG and IgM antibodies
  against Borrelia were elevated in the serum. A cerebrospinal fluid sample was taken,
  and it confirmed the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis, as there was pleocytosis (leucocytes
  80×106/l), intrathecal antibodies against Borrelia and an elevated level of chemokine
  (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was treated
  with oral doxicyclin 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and all her symptoms as well
  as the pericardial effusion disappeared during or soon after this treatment.'

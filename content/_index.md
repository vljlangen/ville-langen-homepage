  #       I am a medical professional specializing in cardiology, internal medicine, and geriatrics. My research focuses on hypertension, cardiovascular health, and geriatric medicine, with a particular interest in data science applications in healthcare.

  #       I combine clinical practice with active research, having completed my PhD in Internal Medicine and published extensively in peer-reviewed journals. My work bridges traditional medicine with modern data analysis techniques.

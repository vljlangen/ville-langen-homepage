abstract: 'Purpose of Review: To review the current evidence on research related to
  age of hypertension onset—its definition, correlates, heritability, and association
  with adverse outcomes. We also propose a framework for implementing assessment of
  hypertension onset age into clinical practice. Recent Findings: Prior studies have
  used both objective measurements and self-report to determine age of hypertension
  onset or early-onset hypertension. Yet, no criterion for standard definition currently
  exists for either. Data from epidemiological and clinical studies demonstrate that
  early-onset hypertension is a highly heritable trait that confers an increased risk
  for cardiovascular death and end-organ damage compared with late-onset hypertension.
  Summary: Literature to date suggests that (parental) age of hypertension onset can
  be feasibly assessed for estimating (1) risk of future hypertension in non-hypertensive
  persons; and (2) the propensity for cardiovascular disease in individuals with established
  hypertension.'

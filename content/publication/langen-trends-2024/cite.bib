 abstract = {Objectives: We assessed if positive life orientation (PLO) has increased among older individuals and explored gender disparities in PLO changes. Methods: Two cohorts of 70-year-olds from Turku, Finland were included: the 1920 birth cohort (examined in 1991; n = 1,032) and the 1940 birth cohort (examined in 2011; n = 956). Participants completed an identical questionnaire assessing life satisfaction, feeling needed, future plans, zest for life, depression, and loneliness. A composite PLO score (range 0–1) was computed.},

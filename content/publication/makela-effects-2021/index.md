abstract: 'Aims: Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause damage
  to the gastric and duodenal mucosa. Some probiotics have proven useful in ameliorating
  the harmful side-effects of NSAIDs. Our aim was to evaluate whether oral administration
  of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 (B420) can attenuate the increase of
  calprotectin excretion into faeces induced by intake of diclofenac sustained-release
  tablets. Methods: A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and randomized
  clinical study was performed in 50 healthy male and female volunteers aged 20–40
  years, in Finland. Study participation consisted of 4 phases: run-in, intervention
  with B420 or placebo, B420 or placebo + NSAID treatment, and follow-up. The primary
  outcome was the concentration of calprotectin in faeces. Secondary outcomes were
  haemoglobin and microbial DNA in faeces and blood haemoglobin levels. Results: Intake
  of diclofenac increased the faecal excretion of calprotectin in both groups. The
  observed increases were 48.19 ± 61.55 μg/g faeces (mean ± standard deviation) in
  the B420 group and 31.30 ± 39.56 μg/g in the placebo group (difference estimate
  16.90; 95% confidence interval: −14.00, 47.77; P =.276). There were no significant
  differences between the treatment groups in changes of faecal or blood haemoglobin.
  Faecal B. lactis DNA was much more abundant in the B420 group compared to the placebo
  group (ANOVA estimate for treatment difference 0.85 × 109/g faeces; 95% confidence
  interval: 0.50 × 109, 1.21 × 109; P textless.0001). Conclusions: Short-term administration
  of the probiotic B420 did not protect the healthy adult study participants from
  diclofenac-induced gastrointestinal inflammation as determined by analysis of faecal
  calprotectin levels.'

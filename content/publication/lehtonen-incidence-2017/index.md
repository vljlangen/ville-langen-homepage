abstract: Background Scant data exist on incidence rates, correlates, and prognosis
  of electrocardiographic P-wave abnormalities in the general population. Methods
  We recorded ECG and measured conventional cardiovascular risk factors in 5667 Finns
  who were followed up for incident atrial fibrillation (AF). We obtained repeat ECGs
  from 3089 individuals 11 years later. Results The incidence rates of prolonged P-wave
  duration, abnormal P terminal force (PTF), left P-wave axis deviation, and right
  P-wave axis deviation were 16.0%, 7.4%, 3.4%, and 2.2%, respectively. Older age
  and higher BMI were associated with incident prolonged P-wave duration and abnormal
  PTF (P ≤ 0.01). Higher blood pressure was associated with incident prolonged P-wave
  duration and right P-wave axis deviation (P ≤ 0.01). During follow-up, only prolonged
  P-wave duration predicted AF (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.38; P = 0.001).
  Conclusions Modifiable risk factors associate with P-wave abnormalities that are
  common and may represent intermediate steps of atrial cardiomyopathy on a pathway
  leading to AF.

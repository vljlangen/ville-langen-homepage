abstract: BACKGROUND Previous data on the association of thyroid function with total
  mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and sudden cardiac death (SCD)
  are conflicting or limited. We investigated associations of thyroid-stimulating
  hormone (TSH) with these outcomes in a nationwide population-based prospective cohort
  study. METHODS We examined 5211 participants representative of the Finnish population
  aged ≥30 years in 2000-2001 and followed them for a median of 13.2 years. Using
  Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for baseline age, gender, smoking,
  diabetes, systolic blood pressure and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
  we assessed the associations of continuous baseline TSH and TSH categories (low
  [textless0.4 mU/L], reference range [0.4-3.4 mU/L] and high [textgreater3.4 mU/L])
  with incident total mortality, SCD, coronary heart disease events, stroke, CVD,
  major adverse cardiac events and atrial fibrillation. RESULTS High TSH at baseline
  was related to a greater risk of total mortality (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02-1.76) and
  SCD (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.13-4.60) compared with TSH within the reference range. High
  TSH was not associated with the other outcomes (P ≥ .51), whereas low TSH was not
  associated with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .09). TSH at baseline over the full range
  did not have a linear relation with any of the outcomes (P ≥ .17). TSH showed a
  U-shaped association with total mortality after a restricted cubic spline transformation
  (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Thyroid function abnormalities could be linked with higher
  risks of total mortality and SCD. Large-scale randomized studies are needed for
  evidence-based recommendations regarding treatment of mild thyroid failure.

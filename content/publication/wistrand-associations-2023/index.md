abstract: 'Purpose: A limited number of studies have suggested a nonlinear association
  between spot urine (SU) sodium concentration and office blood pressure (BP). We
  examined how SU sodium concentration and dietary salt obtained from a food frequency
  questionnaire are associated with more accurately measured home BP in a large, nationwide
  population sample.Materials and methods: We included 1398 participants in cross-sectional
  and 851 participants in 11-year longitudinal analyses. We investigated associations
  between baseline salt/sodium variables and (i) baseline and follow-up home BP; and
  (ii) prevalent and incident hypertension with linear and logistic regression models.Results:
  We observed positive associations (β ± standard error) between salt/sodium variables
  and BP in unadjusted models. SU sodium concentration associated with baseline systolic
  (0.04 ± 0.01, p textless 0.001) and diastolic (0.02 ± 0.01, p textless 0.001) BP
  and follow-up systolic (0.03 ± 0.01, p = 0.003) and diastolic (0.02 ± 0.01, p textless
  0.001) BP. Dietary salt intake was associated with baseline (0.52 ± 0.19, p = 0.008)
  and follow-up (0.57 ± 0.20, p = 0.006) systolic BP. Compared to the lowest quintile
  of SU sodium concentration, the highest quintile had greater odds of prevalent hypertension
  (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.19) and the second highest
  quintile with incident hypertension (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.34). Unadjusted odds
  of incident hypertension were higher in the highest as compared to the lowest quintile
  of dietary salt intake (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.01-3.35). After adjustments for sex, age,
  plasma creatinine concentration and alcohol intake, none of the aforementioned associations
  remained statistically significant. We found no evidence of a J-shaped association
  between the salt/sodium variables and BP or hypertension.Conclusion: SU sodium concentration
  and dietary salt intake are associated with home BP and hypertension only in some
  of the unadjusted models. Our results underscore that feasible estimation of sodium
  intake remains challenging in epidemiology. What is known about the topicSome studies
  have suggested a non-linear association between spot urine sodium and blood pressure24-hour
  urinary sodium sampling is the gold standard method for assessing sodium intakeWhat
  this study addsMultiple fractional polynomials did not reveal evidence of a J-shaped
  association between spot urine sodium or dietary salt intake (measured by a questionnaire)
  and home blood pressurePrecise and yet feasible estimation of sodium intake remains
  challenging in epidemiology.'

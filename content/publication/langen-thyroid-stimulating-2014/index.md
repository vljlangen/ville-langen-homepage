abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Previous studies with mainly selected populations have proposed
  contradicting reference ranges for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and have disagreed
  on how screening, age and gender affect them. This study aimed to determine a TSH
  reference range on the Abbott Architect ci8200 integrated system in a large, nationwide,
  stratified random sample. To our knowledge this is the only study apart from the
  NHANES III that has addressed this issue in a similar nationwide setting. The effects
  of age, gender, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)-positivity and medications on
  TSH reference range were also assessed. METHODS: TSH was measured from 6247 participants
  randomly drawn from the population register to represent the Finnish adult population.
  TSH reference ranges were established of a thyroid-healthy population and its subpopulations
  with increasing and cumulative rigour of screening: screening for overt thyroid
  disease (thyroid-healthy population, n=5709); screening for TPOAb-positivity (risk
  factor-free subpopulation, n=4586); and screening for use of any medications (reference
  subpopulation, n=1849). RESULTS: The TSH reference ranges of the thyroid-healthy
  population, and the risk factor-free and reference subpopulations were 0.4-4.4,
  0.4-3.7 and 0.4-3.4 mU/L (2.5th-97.5th percentiles), respectively. Although the
  differences in TSH between subgroups for age (p=0.002) and gender (p=0.005) reached
  statistical significance, the TSH distribution curves of the subgroups were practically
  superimposed. CONCLUSIONS: We propose 0.4-3.4 mU/L as a TSH reference range for
  adults for this platform, which is lower than those presently used in most laboratories.
  Our findings suggest that intensive screening for thyroid risk factors, especially
  for TPOAb-positivity, decreases the TSH upper reference limit.'

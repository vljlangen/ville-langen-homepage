abstract: 'Aims Little is known about rural-urban differences in the treatment and
  outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to assess whether the
  initiation of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy in patients with AF differs between
  those with rural and urban residence. Methods The registry-based FinACAF cohort
  covers all patients with AF from all levels of care in Finland. Patients were divided
  into rural and urban categories and into urbanization degree tertiles based on their
  municipality of residence at the time of AF diagnosis. The outcome was the first
  redeemed OAC prescription. Results We identified 222 419 patients (50.1% female;
  mean age 72.8 (SD 13.2) years) with incident AF during 2007–2018. Urban residence
  was associated with a lower rate of OAC therapy initiation (adjusted subdistribution
  hazard ratio (SHR) (95% CI) 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). Correspondingly, an inverse graded
  dose-response relationship was observed between higher urbanization degree tertile
  and OAC initiation rate (highest tertile compared to lowest: adjusted SHR (95% CI)
  0.94 (0.93–0.95)). The adoption of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention
  was faster among patients with urban residence. Conclusion This nationwide cohort
  study documented that urban residence is associated with a slightly lower rate of
  OAC therapy initiation in patients with incident AF, but faster adoption of direct
  oral anticoagulant use.'
